## AlphaEvolve: A Gemini-powered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms

Here is the translated content:

Document describes the technological advancements of the DeepMind team over the past decade, including products such as AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and AlphaFold. These products have proven AI's ability in complex decision-making fields and its potential to surpass human capabilities.

Among them, AlphaEvolve is a new product that can achieve cross-disciplinary scientific discoveries through a cycle of "AI training AI". This means AlphaEvolve not only solves single-field problems but also generates new algorithms and methods, even helping define new problems.

However, the document also mentions controversies and challenges brought by AlphaEvolve. For example, its underlying thought process is difficult for humans to fully understand, leading to a black-box phenomenon that makes it hard to verify and reproduce research results. Furthermore, this technology centralization may lead to oligopolization in AI research, making it difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises and academic institutions to access comparable computational power and algorithmic resources.

The document emphasizes the importance of human-machine cooperative cycles, where humans provide value judgments and AI executes efficient exploration. This synergy may open a new era of enhanced research. Finally, it quotes Google CEO Sundar Pichai's statement that AI is not an endpoint but rather a new starting point for humans to explore the unknown.

文中描述的是DeepMind团队在过去十年间所进行的技术发展，包括AlphaGo、AlphaZero、AlphaFold等一系列的颠覆性产品。这些产品证明了AI在复杂决策领域的能力，以及其能够超越人类的潜力。

其中AlphaEvolve是一个新的产品，它能够通过“AI训练AI”的循环反馈实现跨学科的科学发现。这意味着AlphaEvolve不仅能解决单一领域的问题，还能生成新的算法和方法，甚至可以帮助定义新问题。

然而，文中也提到了AlphaEvolve带来的争议和挑战。例如，它的背后的思维过程难以被人类完全理解，导致黑箱化的过程可能使科研成果难以被验证和复现。同时，这种技术集中化可能导致AI科研寡头化，大量中小企业和学术机构难以获得同等的算力和算法资源。

文中强调了人机协作循环的重要性，人类提供价值判断，AI执行高效探索，这种协同可能会开启增强型科研的新时代。最后，提到了谷歌CEO桑达尔·皮查伊的说法，AI不是终点，而是人类探索未知的新起点。
