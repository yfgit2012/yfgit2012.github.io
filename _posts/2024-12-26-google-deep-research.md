This article discusses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, focusing on the definition of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), level 3 AGI, and Deep Research. The author emphasizes that we should not underestimate ourselves and proposes a new perspective on defining this game, where intelligence is cooperative rather than replacement-based.

The article mentions that OpenAI's AGI framework is set at level 2, but Deep Research has already reached level 3. The author believes that this level 3 AGI can be used and helps humans improve their reasoning ability, critical thinking, and abstract thinking.

Comparing to human intelligence, the author notes that our reasoning ability is not strong enough and our information processing efficiency is limited, which leads to a new perspective on defining this game. The author argues that we should not underestimate ourselves but rather change our view, redefining intelligence as cooperative rather than replacement-based.

The article then introduces Deep Research's functions and its significant advantages in knowledge reasoning and information processing, providing several examples to demonstrate its capabilities.

这是一篇关于人工智能（AI）和机器学习的文章，主要探讨了AGI（强人工智能）的定义、level 3级别的AGI和Deep Research等概念。作者强调了我们不应妄自菲薄，并提出了重新定义这一场游戏的观点，即智能应该是协同式的，而不是取代人类的游戏。

文章中提到，目前OpenAI设定的AGI框架为level 2级别，但Deep Research已经达到level 3级别。作者认为，这个level 3级别的AGI可以用起来，并且能够帮助人类在推理能力、批判性思维和抽象思维方面取得进步。

文中也提到了对比之下，我们的人类推理能力不够强，信息处理效率太受局限，这就引出了重新定义这一场游戏的观点。作者认为，我们不应妄自菲薄，而应该改变视角，重新定义智能的概念，认为智能是协同式的。

最后，文章介绍了Deep Research的功能，以及它在知识推理信息处理方面的强大优势，并提供了几个案例用于展示其能力。
