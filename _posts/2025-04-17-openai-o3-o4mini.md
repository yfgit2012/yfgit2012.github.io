This article mainly discusses Geoffrey Elman's views on educational technology, human-computer interaction research, and technological development. Elman believes that although technology can change teaching methods, it cannot replace the role of teachers because students need guidance and help during the learning process.

He mentioned the limitations of MOOCs, pointing out that 95% of students who take them still cannot reach their educational goals due to a lack of personalized help and guidance. Elman emphasized that teachers' roles are irreplaceable in providing timely help, assistance, and guidance to students as they encounter problems.

At the same time, Elman also discussed the development of human-computer interaction and its differences in meeting the needs of older people. He mentioned his own difficulties in learning new technologies, such as using Google Maps and car navigation systems. Furthermore, he thinks that the tech industry should consider the preferences, needs, and differences of older people.

Finally, Elman expressed his views on quantum computing and general artificial intelligence, saying that despite their potential, they still need development to realize their true power. He also worries that people's expectations for these new technologies may exceed their actual capabilities.

这篇文章主要讲述了杰弗里·厄尔曼对教育技术、人机交互研究以及科技发展的看法。厄尔曼认为，尽管技术可以改变教学流程，但它并不能取代教师的作用，因为学生在学习过程中需要帮助和指导。

他提到了慕课的局限性，指出95%的学生通过慕课还是无法达到教育目标，因为它们缺乏个体化的帮助和指导。厄尔曼强调，老师的作用是随时帮助学生解决问题、提供帮助和引导，这是不可替代的。

同时，厄尔曼也讨论了人机交互领域的发展与老年人的需求差异。他提到了自己在学习新技术方面遇到的困难，比如使用谷歌地图与车载导航系统等。并且，他认为科技行业需要考虑到老年人的偏好、需求和差异。

最后，厄尔曼表示他对量子计算和通用人工智能的看法，即使这些技术有前景，但还需要经过发展以实现真正的潜力。他也担心人们对这些新技术的期待可能超过了它们实际的能力。
