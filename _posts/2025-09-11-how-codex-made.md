## How OpenAI made Codex

<think>
Okay, let me process this step by step. The user provided a document in Chinese and wants a summary and key points. First, I need to confirm the language. The text is in Chinese, so the summary should be in Chinese as per the instructions.

The main content discusses Codex, an AI programming tool by OpenAI, comparing it with other tools like GPT-5 Pro and Claude Code. It highlights Codex's success due to product refinement and ecosystem integration. The article also covers Codex's evolution from a code completion tool to an AI Agent capable of modifying code and handling tasks in a cloud environment. Safety measures are mentioned to prevent security risks, and the cloud-based approach leads to higher PR merging rates. Future directions include local deployment options and collaboration features. The impact of AI on software engineering and adapting learning methods are also addressed.

For the summary, I need to condense this into a few paragraphs, keeping it under 50% of the original length. The summary should mention Codex's rise due to OpenAI's product integration, its cloud-based Agent capabilities, safety measures, and higher PR merging rates compared to competitors. Also, the shift from code completion to full code modification, security layers, user interaction improvements, and future directions like local deployment and collaboration tools. 

The key points should list each important aspect: Codex's evolution, cloud vs local deployment, security features, PR merging rates, user interaction, collaboration, and the impact on software engineering education. 

I need to ensure the summary is concise, captures all main points, and the key points are clear and distinct. Also, check that the summary is in Chinese as required. Let me structure the summary first, then the key points.

Codex作为OpenAI的AI编程工具，凭借产品打磨与生态整合能力，成为当前最实用的AI编程产品。其核心优势在于云端Agent形态，能自主处理代码任务并生成PR，合并率高达80%，远超竞品。团队通过终端Agent迭代优化，解决安全风险，采用三层防护机制，确保代码安全。用户偏好多轮交互调整代码，推动Codex优化迭代效率，如容器复用和增量编译。未来将兼顾云端与本地部署，实现统一协作，新增“Best-of-N”功能生成多方案供选择。AI正在重塑软件工程，加速遗留系统迁移，但软件工程学习仍具价值，需转向项目驱动与AI协作模式。  

**关键点**：  
1. Codex通过云端Agent实现代码自主处理，合并率远超竞比；  
2. 安全设计三层防护（提示词层、执行层、结果层）规避恶意指令风险；  
3. 用户多轮交互需求推动产品优化，提升迭代效率；  
4. 未来支持本地部署与云端协同，兼顾安全与便捷性；  
5. AI加速软件工程变革，但需调整学习方式，强调项目实践与AI协作；  
6. Codex助力遗留系统迁移，显著降低技术债务与成本。</document>

Okay, I need to analyze the provided article and create a summary and key points. Let me start by reading through the document carefully. The article discusses Codex, an AI programming tool developed by OpenAI, and compares it with other tools like GPT-5 Pro and Claude Code. It mentions that Codex's success is due to its product refinement and ecosystem integration, which are better than Anthropic's. The article also talks about the evolution of Codex from a code completion tool to an AI Agent that can modify code and handle tasks in a cloud environment. There's a focus on safety measures to prevent security risks, and how Codex's cloud-based approach leads to higher PR merging rates. The article also touches on the future of Codex, including local deployment options and collaboration features. Additionally, it addresses the impact of AI on software engineering and the importance of adapting learning methods.

Now, I need to summarize this into a few paragraphs, keeping it under 50% of the original length. The summary should be in the same language as the article, which is Chinese. Then, I have to list the key points. Let me make sure not to include any preambles or extra content. 

First, the summary should mention Codex's rise due to OpenAI's product integration, its cloud-based Agent capabilities, safety measures, and higher PR merging rates compared to competitors. Also, the shift from code completion to full code modification, the security layers, user interaction improvements, and the future directions like local deployment and collaboration tools. 

For key points, I need to list each important aspect: Codex's evolution, cloud vs local deployment, security features, PR merging rates, user interaction, collaboration, and the impact on software engineering education. 

I should check that the summary is concise and captures all main points without going into too much detail. Also, ensure that the key points are clear and distinct. Let me structure the summary first, then the key points.
