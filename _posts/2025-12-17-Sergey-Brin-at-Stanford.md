## Sergey Brin interview at Stanford

**Article Summary (Chinese)**  
At the centennial celebration of Stanford University's School of Engineering, Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, made a rare public appearance, reflecting on Google's development history and candidly discussing the gains and losses in the AI era. He shared his early experiences at Stanford, including the "hacker spirit" of physically picking locks to access computer resources and the failed pizza ordering system project. Brin emphasized Google's long-term investment in AI (such as TPU chip development) and the importance of algorithm optimization, while also reflecting on Google's delayed commercialization of generative AI. He pointed out that AI's future requires breaking free from reliance on computational power, shifting toward algorithmic innovation, and encouraging students to focus on hard technology and fundamental principles rather than chasing short-term trends. Brin also mentioned that AI is becoming a new form of intelligence, potentially reshaping research methods in scientific fields, and called for maintaining curiosity about the essence of technology.

**Key Points Summary (Chinese)**  
- **Event Background**: At the centennial celebration of Stanford University's School of Engineering, Sergey Brin was invited to reflect on Google's development history and candidly discuss the challenges and opportunities in the AI era.  
- **Early Experiences**:  
  - Brin was known for his "hacker spirit" at Stanford, famously accessing computer resources through physical lock-picking and climbing windows.  
  - In the mid-1990s, he and Larry Page developed the PageRank algorithm, laying the foundation for Google's search engine core logic.  
- **Failed Projects**:  
  - An early attempt to build a pizza ordering system failed due to the lack of fax machines in pizza shops at the time, making the project non-viable.  
- **AI Strategy Reflections**:  
  - Although Google proposed the Transformer architecture in 2017, hesitancy in commercialization caused it to miss the generative AI revolution, which was led by OpenAI.  
  - Emphasized the need for AI development to break free from reliance on computational power, shifting toward algorithmic optimization (e.g., more efficient inference mechanisms).  
- **Hard Technology Investment**:  
  - Google's early long-term investment in foundational technologies (e.g., TPU chip development) created a technological moat, but faced challenges in adapting to explosive applications.  
- **AI Future Outlook**:  
  - AI may become a new form of intelligence, driving complex data processing in fields like materials science and biology.  
  - Proposed that "algorithm breakthroughs" could surpass computational power stacking, such as more sparse model designs.  
- **Advice to Students**:  
  - Avoid chasing short-term trends (e.g., simple web projects during the internet bubble), instead focusing on hard technology (e.g., quantum computing, nuclear fusion, AI mathematical principles).  
  - Stress the importance of exploring fundamental principles rather than merely focusing on technological surface-level applications.

**Analysis**  
The article, through Brin's personal experiences and reflections, reveals the strategic choices and limitations of tech giants in the AI era. Its core argument is that **long-termism and breakthroughs in fundamental technology are the roots of innovation**, rather than relying solely on computational power. Additionally, Brin's predictions about AI's future (e.g., algorithmic optimization potential, scientific field applications) provide new perspectives for the industry, while his advice to students underscores the importance of "deep thinking" and "hard technology exploration," echoing the essence of his early "hacker spirit."
