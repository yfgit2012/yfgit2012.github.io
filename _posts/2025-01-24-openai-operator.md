## OpenAI Operator launch

It looks like a transcript of a presentation or demo about a new product, specifically "Operator". Here's a breakdown of the key points:

**Key Points**

1. **Introduction**: The presenter introduces Operator as a research preview that aims to help users complete tasks by interacting with them in a conversational way.
2. **Safety and Ongoing Process**: The presenter emphasizes the importance of safety and acknowledges that Operator is not perfect, but rather a tool that can make mistakes.
3. **Deployment Strategy**: They explain that they are starting small, iterating on their mitigations as they go, and hope to learn a lot from this deployment.
4. **Task Completion**: The presenter demonstrates how Operator can complete tasks such as purchasing tickets, booking a tennis court, and ordering groceries.
5. **Reliability**: They discuss the reliability of Operator in practice, mentioning that it will make mistakes and is not perfect, but has shown promising results in benchmarks.
6. **Benchmarks**: Two benchmarks are mentioned: OS World (evaluating navigation on common operating systems) and Web Arena (evaluating navigation on websites). Operator's performance on these tasks is discussed.
7. **Future Plans**: The presenter mentions that the API for Operator will be available soon, allowing developers to integrate it into their applications.

**Takeaways**

1. Operator is a conversational AI tool designed to help users complete tasks.
2. It's still in early research preview and not perfect, but showing promising results.
3. Operator can complete various tasks, such as purchasing tickets and ordering groceries.
4. The product will be rolled out slowly, starting with Pro users in the US.
