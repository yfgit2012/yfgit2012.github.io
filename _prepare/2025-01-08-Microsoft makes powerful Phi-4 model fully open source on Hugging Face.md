Microsoft makes Phi-4 model fully open-source on Hugging Face
 
  Microsoft is releasing its Phi-4 model as a fully open-source project with downloadable weights on Hugging Face, the AI code-sharing community. The model's weights are established by its training process and can be further adjusted by human researchers. 
 
  Phi-4 was initially revealed by Microsoft last month, but its usage was restricted to Microsoft's Azure AI Foundry development platform. Now, it is available outside that proprietary service to anyone who has a Hugging Face account.
 
  The model excels in benchmarks that test advanced reasoning and domain-specific capabilities, including scoring over 80% in challenging benchmarks like MATH and MGSM. Its architecture and training process were designed with precision and efficiency in mind, making it a strong choice for AI-assisted programming.
 
  By making Phi-4 available on Hugging Face with its full weights and an MIT License, Microsoft is opening it up for businesses to use in their commercial operations, aligning with the growing trend of open-sourcing foundational AI models.

  微软将Phi-4模型开源并发布在Hugging Face上
   微软正在将其Phi-4模型作为一个完全开源的项目，与可下载权重一起，发布在Hugging Face社区中。该模型的权重由其训练过程建立，可以让人类研究者进一步调整。
  
  Phi-4 最初是在去月份由微软公布的，但其使用仅限于微软的Azure AI Foundry开发平台。现在，它已经可供任何拥有Hugging Face账户的人使用。
  
  该模型在测试高级推理和领域特定能力的基准中表现出色，包括MATH和MGSM等挑战性的基准中的超过80%的评分。其架构和训练过程以精确和效率为设计目标，使其成为强大的AI辅助编程选择。
  
  微软通过将Phi-4在Hugging Face上发布，并附带完整权重和MIT许可证，将其开源，以便商业使用，符合逐渐普及的基础AI模型开源趋势。
