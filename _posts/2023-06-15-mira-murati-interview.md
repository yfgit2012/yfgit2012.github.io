## Emily Chang interview Mira Murati at OpenAI

The text appears to be an interview or discussion transcript on the topic of AI, specifically related to OpenAI. The speaker discusses various aspects of AI development, including its potential risks, such as human extinction, and the importance of responsible innovation.

Some key points from the transcript include:

1. **OpenAI's evolution**: The company has shifted from a non-profit to a for-profit model, with a commercial arm that brings in revenue while maintaining a non-profit mission.
2. **Risk of AI misuse**: OpenAI delayed releasing its Dolly AI model due to concerns about potential misuse, such as creating child sexual material or deepfakes.
3. **Transparency and trust**: The speaker emphasizes the need for more transparency in AI development, but acknowledges that it's challenging to agree on what is acceptable behavior for AI systems.
4. **Responsible innovation**: The speaker advocates for building safe AI systems that are generalizable, complex, and difficult to achieve. They suggest creating a trusted authority, like the FDA, to audit AI systems based on agreed-upon principles.
5. **AGI and human extinction risk**: The speaker acknowledges the potential risk of AGI leading to human extinction but believes it's still uncertain how close we are to achieving true AGI.

The transcript also touches on the idea that advancements in society come from pushing human knowledge, but not in careless and reckless ways. This discussion highlights the complexities and challenges surrounding AI development and the need for a nuanced approach to responsible innovation.

某些关键点从该转录中提及：

1. **OpenAI的演变**：公司已经从非营利模式转向了盈利模式，有一个商业部门为其带来了收入，同时也维持着非营利使命。
2. **人工智能滥用风险**：由于担心潜在的滥用，如创建儿童色情内容或深度造假，OpenAI推迟了Dolly AI模型的发布。
3. **透明度和信任**：发言者强调需要更多地在人工智能开发中增加透明度，但承认很难同意什么是可以接受的人工智能系统的行为。
4. **负责任的创新**：发言者倡导建造安全的、通用化、复杂且难以实现的AI系统，他们建议建立一个受信任的权威机构，如FDA，对基于一致的原则审查AI系统。
5. **AGI和人类灭绝风险**：发言者承认了AGI可能导致人类灭绝的潜在风险，但认为它仍然不确定我们距离实现真正的人工智能有多近。

这段转录还谈到了推动社会进步是来源于推动人类知识的想法，但不是肆意和鲁莽地如此。这次讨论突显了围绕人工智能开发的复杂性和挑战，以及对负责任的创新需要细致入微的方法。 </document>
