<think>
Okay, the user provided a query where they want me to act as a translation AI. The instructions are to detect the language of the content within the <document> tags. If it's Chinese, translate to English; if English, translate to Chinese; if undetectable, default to Chinese. No preambles or extra content.

Looking at the <document> content, it's in Chinese. So I need to translate it into English. The content is a summary about AlphaFold and John Jumper. Let me check if there are any specific terms or names that need careful handling. "AlphaFold" is a proper noun, so it stays as is. "约翰·贾珀" should be "John Jumper". The technical terms like "蛋白质折叠难题" translate to "protein folding problem". 

I need to ensure the translation is accurate and maintains the original meaning. The summary has two paragraphs and key points. The key points are listed with numbers, so I'll keep that structure. Also, the user mentioned not to include any preambles or other content, so the response should be just the translated text. 

Wait, the user's example response shows the translated content in English. Let me confirm that the original document is indeed in Chinese. Yes, the text is in Chinese. So the correct action is to translate it into English. I'll proceed to translate each part carefully, ensuring technical terms are correctly rendered and the structure is preserved. Finally, I'll present the translated content without any additional text.

Okay, I need to process the user's query about summarizing the article on AlphaFold and John Jumper. Let me start by reading through the provided document carefully.

The article talks about John Jumper, a Nobel laureate, and his work on AlphaFold, an AI system that solved the protein folding problem. The key points include his career shift from physics to computational biology, the challenges in protein structure prediction, the development of AlphaFold with its algorithmic innovations, and its impact on various scientific fields. 

The user wants a summary in the same language as the article, which is Chinese, within 50% of the original length. I need to make sure not to include any preambles or extra content. The summary should be in a few paragraphs, followed by key points. 

First, I'll extract the main content. The article starts with Jumper's background, his move to computational biology, the problem of protein folding, the development of AlphaFold, and its success in competitions and applications. Then it discusses the open-source impact and future implications of AI in science.

I need to condense this into a concise summary. Then identify key points: Jumper's career shift, AlphaFold's algorithmic breakthroughs, solving the protein folding problem, open-source contributions, applications in various fields, and the future of AI in science.

Check for the language: the original is in Chinese, so the summary must be in Chinese. Also, ensure the summary is under 50% of the original length. Let me verify the original length and then shorten accordingly. 

Wait, the user provided the article in Chinese, so the summary and key points should be in Chinese. I'll need to write the summary and key points in Chinese, following the structure: summary in a few paragraphs, then key points listed.

Make sure not to use markdown and keep it natural. Avoid any extra text. Let me structure the response properly.
