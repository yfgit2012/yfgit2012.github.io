## Robotaxi and its story



特斯拉Robotaxi在奥斯汀启动试运营，首批仅开放10-20辆Model Y，用户需通过邀请制体验。该服务采用纯视觉技术，运营时间限6点至12点，定价4.2美元，仅为象征性收费。测试范围局限于科罗拉多河南岸，配备安全员监控，但未在驾驶座。Yu Zhenhua称Robotaxi具备成本优势，但需扩大测试区域和车队规模以实现盈利。市场对特斯拉能否颠覆传统出行模式持乐观态度，但华尔街反应分化，股价波动显示投资者对技术安全性和监管风险的疑虑。试运营中出现车辆异常震动、误判刹车等问题，引发美国交通部介入调查。特斯拉需在合规框架下解决技术缺陷，同时应对Waymo等竞品的挑战。长期盈利依赖规模化和成本控制，但当前仍面临监管和安全验证的不确定性。

Tesla's Robotaxi trial launched in Austin, with only 10-20 Model Y vehicles initially available via invitation. The service operates between 6 a.m. and 12 p.m., priced at $4.2, a symbolic rate. Testing is restricted to the southern bank of the Colorado River, with a safety officer in the co-pilot seat. Yu Zhenhua, a former Tesla engineer, highlighted the cost advantage of Robotaxi but emphasized the need for expanded testing areas and fleet scaling to achieve profitability. While Wall Street remains optimistic about Tesla's potential to disrupt traditional mobility, stock fluctuations reflect investor concerns over technical safety and regulatory risks. Issues like vehicle vibration and braking misjudgment during trials have prompted U.S. Department of Transportation investigations. Tesla must address technical flaws within compliance frameworks while competing against Waymo and others. Long-term profitability hinges on scalability and cost control, though regulatory and safety validation uncertainties persist.
