These models have been designed for advanced users and are capable of handling complex programming problems and high-level reasoning tasks. The company emphasized the capabilities of these models in various benchmark tests, including coding and multiple language understanding (MMMLU) scenarios.

CEO Dario Amodei opened the conference by introducing Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 as the latest additions to Anthropic's AI lineup. He highlighted their ability to handle complex tasks independently for several hours and emphasized that these models are designed for advanced users, including Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise subscribers.

During the event, Mike Krieger (co-founder of Instagram) discussed the capabilities of Claude 4 series models in greater detail. He emphasized that Opus 4 can understand code libraries and plan the addition of content with high efficiency and accuracy, while Sonnet 4 offers a balance between performance and efficiency.
