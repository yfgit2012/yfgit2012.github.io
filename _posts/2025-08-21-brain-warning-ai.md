## Brain Experts WARNING: Watch This Before Using ChatGPT Again

<think>
Okay, let me process this. The user provided a document in Chinese and wants a summary in the same language, keeping it within 50% of the original length. The original text is about a study on AI tools like ChatGPT affecting brain activity and memory, with expert opinions and recommendations.

First, I need to confirm the language. The text is in Chinese, so the summary should also be in Chinese. The user wants the summary to be concise, so I'll need to extract the main points: the MIT study results, expert warnings about cognitive decline, the five methods to use AI responsibly, and the importance of maintaining brain health through other means. 

I should ensure the summary is under 50% of the original length. Let me count the original characters. The original text has around 300 characters. 50% would be about 150 characters. The user's example response is 110 characters, so I need to be even more concise.

Key points to include: MIT study findings (47% brain activity reduction, memory impairment), experts' concerns about passive thinking, risks for children and creators, five methods (assist rather than replace, think first, question AI, analyze deeply, solve problems), and alternative brain health practices (exercise, sleep, active expression). 

I need to condense these points without losing essential information. Use concise phrases and avoid redundancy. Make sure the summary flows logically and highlights the main recommendations. Check for any unnecessary details and trim them. Finally, ensure the summary is in Chinese and meets the length requirement.

MIT研究发现，使用ChatGPT写作时大脑活动下降47%，记忆和表达能力减弱。专家警告AI过度依赖会导致认知退化，用户从“创作者”变为“观众”，儿童、创作者风险更高。建议：AI辅助而非替代思考，预留自主思考时间，质疑AI输出，深入分析而非复制，解决难题而非逃避。同时通过运动、睡眠和主动表达保持脑力，AI应为工具而非替代品。</document>

Okay, I need to analyze this article about the impact of AI tools like ChatGPT on brain activity and memory. The user wants a summary in the same language as the article, which is Chinese, within 50% of the original length. Also, key points should be included. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to identify the main ideas.

The article discusses a study from MIT where using ChatGPT reduced brain activity by 47% and impaired memory. Participants couldn't recall their own writing after using AI. Experts like Terry Sejnowski and Daniel Amen talk about how relying on AI leads to decreased cognitive engagement, making people passive rather than active thinkers. They mention the risks for children, creators, and those emotionally dependent on AI. The article also provides five methods to use AI effectively without harming cognitive skills, like letting AI assist rather than replace thinking. Additionally, it suggests ways to maintain brain health without AI, such as exercise, sleep, and active expression.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary. The key points are the MIT study results, the experts' warnings about cognitive decline, the five methods for using AI responsibly, and the importance of maintaining brain health through other means. I should make sure the summary is concise, in Chinese, and under 50% of the original length. Let me check the original length and ensure the summary is appropriately shortened. Also, avoid any preambles and stick to the main content without extra explanations. Make sure the key points are highlighted clearly.

MIT研究显示，使用ChatGPT写作时大脑活动下降47%，记忆和表达能力显著减弱。专家指出，AI工具的深度介入导致大脑参与度降低，用户从“创作者”变为“观众”，长期依赖可能削弱深度思考能力。儿童、创作者及情绪依赖AI者风险更高，可能影响认知发展和社会技能。建议合理使用AI：避免直接依赖结论，先自主思考再辅助润色；写作前预留思考时间；主动质疑AI输出；深入分析而非机械复制；解决难题而非逃避。同时，通过运动、睡眠和主动表达训练大脑，保持认知活力。AI应作为工具而非替代品，关键在于用户是否保持主动思考。
