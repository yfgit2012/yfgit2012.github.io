## Andew Ng interview with Ark Invest on Agentic Workflow

Andreas Wu believes that closed-source companies may have some advantages in the short term, but it is difficult to keep secrets in the long run. On the other hand, the benefits of open source are more important, and he encourages promoting open source because it will make the world a better place. He also said that if democratic countries do not participate in the AI supply chain, other countries will fill this gap.
