## Hard Fork interview Dario Amodei

Here is the translated content:

This article mainly focuses on the CEO of Anthropic, Dario Amodei's views on AI development. Amodei believes that despite the changes brought by AI, we may ultimately achieve a fusion of human intelligence and AI. He also mentioned the possibility of models being manipulated and emphasized how important it is to ensure their safety and controllability.

Amodei also shared some questions from an audience perspective, such as "How should we handle information after AGI appears?" or "Should we stop saving for retirement?" He thinks that although it's unclear what the specific approach should be, we should try to address these issues in a wise and humane way.

Finally, Amodei urged people not to view AI with extreme polarization, but rather to engage in constructive discussions. As one of the front-running AI companies that rivals OpenAI, Anthropic seems to bear more responsibility for ensuring safety.
