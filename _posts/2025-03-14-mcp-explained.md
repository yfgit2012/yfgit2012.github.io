## MCP explained

It seems like the text is from an interview with Ross Mike (also known as Professor Ross Mike) on a podcast. The conversation revolves around mCP, which stands for Model Code Protocol.

Here's a brief summary of what was discussed:

Ross Mike explains that mCP is a standard protocol that allows different Large Language Models (LLMs) to access and share resources in a structured way. He emphasizes the importance of following this standard protocol to ensure seamless integration and user experience.

The conversation then shifts to the potential business opportunities arising from popularized protocols, such as HTTPS or SMTP. Ross Mike suggests that when a new standard like mCP is established, it opens up new possibilities for businesses and developers to build upon it.

For non-technical listeners, Ross Mike recommends staying updated on the platforms building out mCP capability and keeping an eye on the final standardization process. He emphasizes that once the standard is finalized, it will be easier to integrate and develop new applications using this protocol.

Ross Mike also proposes the idea of an "mCP App Store" where users can find and deploy different mCP servers with a single click. He encourages technical listeners to explore this idea further and even offers his domain as a starting point.

Overall, the conversation highlights the importance of understanding how protocols like mCP work, not just for technical experts but also for non-technical business owners and developers who want to stay ahead in the AI coding world.

Ross Mike 解释说，mCP 是一个标准协议，让不同的大型语言模型 (LLM) 可以访问和共享资源的方式。 他强调遵循这个标准协议的重要性，以确保无缝的集成和用户体验。

 话题转移到了因为流行化的协议而产生的商业机会，如 HTTPS 或 SMTP。Ross Mike 建议，當一個新的標準如 mCP 被建立時，它會為企業和開發者創造新機會。

 对于非技术听众， Ross Mike 推荐保持对平台中mCP能力的更新，并关注标准化过程的最后一步。他强调，一旦标准化完成，会更容易整合和开发新的应用使用该协议。

Ross Mike 也建议，建立一个 "mCP 应用商店"，用户可以通过单击找到和部署不同的 mCP 服务器。 他鼓励技术听众进一步探索这个想法，并提供他的域名作为起点。

 总体来说，这个讨论突出了理解如 mCP 这样的协议的重要性，不仅对技术专家，而且对非技术的企业主和开发者，他们希望在人工智能编程世界中领先。
