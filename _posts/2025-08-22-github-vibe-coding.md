## GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke on Copilot, vibe coding, and AI’s next chapter

This is a summary of the interview content with Thomas Dorman, CEO of GitHub, covering competition in the AI programming field, technological development, and future trends:

---

### **1. Competitive Landscape in AI Programming**  
- **Intense Industry Competition**: AI programming assistants are one of the most fiercely competitive sub-sectors in AI, with companies like Cursor, Lovable, and Windsurf rapidly rising and creating intense competition.  
- **GitHub Copilot's Positioning**: Although GitHub Copilot was one of the earliest products in the AI programming assistant space, it has recently faced declining user attention. Dorman believes AI code generation is at the forefront of innovation, with competition centered on enhancing model capabilities and optimizing developer experiences.  
- **Cursor's Differentiation Strategy**: Cursor maintains a leading position by re-designing IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) to create "AI-native" workflows, rather than simply embedding AI as an add-on in traditional IDEs. This innovation allows it to stay ahead in the industry.  
- **Importance of Multi-Model Choice**: Dorman emphasizes that developer tools should provide multi-model selection options, allowing users to freely switch between models (e.g., GPT-3.5, Claude Sonnet) rather than being dictated by the platform. This philosophy has become a key factor in competition within the AI programming field.

### **2. Market Position and Challenges of GitHub Copilot**  
- **Significant User Growth**: GitHub Copilot currently has 20 million users, representing a 75% year-over-year increase, with coverage across 90 Fortune 100 companies. Its user base on VS Code reaches 55 million, demonstrating widespread market penetration.  
- **Technical Iteration and Challenges**: GitHub Copilot started its transition from single-modal to multi-modal support relatively late (introduced AIC support in October 2023). However, Dorman believes the true test for enterprises is resilience under pressure, rather than short-term hype.  
- **Role of the Ecosystem**: GitHub is both a competitor and part of the broader AI programming ecosystem. Its collaborations with Microsoft and OpenAI (e.g., the creation of Copilot) have driven industry innovation, while also benefiting from the ecosystem's growth.

### **3. Progress in Microsoft and OpenAI Collaboration**  
- **Adjustments in Corporate Relationships**: Microsoft and OpenAI are discussing new corporate collaboration models, as OpenAI transitioned from a non-profit to a for-profit entity. As a major shareholder (with exclusive IP access rights), Microsoft must ensure mutual benefits in the partnership.  
- **History and Future of Collaboration**: Initially, Copilot's development relied on OpenAI's GPT-3 and Codex models, along with Microsoft's infrastructure and AI expertise. Dorman believes this collaborative model will continue to drive industry innovation and may attract more competitors to join.

### **4. Views on AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and Superintelligence**  
- **Ambiguous Definition**: Dorman argues that the definitions of AGI or superintelligence (ASI) remain unclear, and their practical importance is limited (unless specified in contracts or as a marketing tool).  
- **Key Focus on Self-Improvement**: He suggests that the hallmark of AGI is its ability to self-evolve, such as models transitioning from GPT-4 to GPT-5 without human intervention, or achieving self-awareness akin to humans (e.g., evolving from being amused by jokes to creating them).  
- **Human-Recognized Intelligence**: True intelligence should involve continuous self-evolution and improvement, rather than merely solving specific problems. This aligns with the dynamic nature of human cognition.

---

### **5. Industry Trends and Future Outlook**  
- **Growing Demand for Developers**: Software development will only increase, along with the number of developers, driving continuous iteration of tools and platforms.  
- **Uncertainty in Technological Evolution**: The AI programming field is highly competitive and technologically fast-paced, with model capabilities (e.g., Claude Sonnet, Llama series) and industry landscapes potentially changing rapidly.  
- **Collaboration Between Tools and Developers**: Anthropic's Claude Sonnet leads in coding due to its training in "tool usage," enabling models to reasonably call various tools (e.g., installing NPM packages) like developers. This capability has become central to the Agent model.

### **Summary**  
Thomas Dorman's interview highlights the rapid evolution in the AI programming field: from GitHub Copilot's market challenges to Cursor's innovative design, from Microsoft and OpenAI's collaboration to philosophical reflections on AGI. In the future, competition in AI programming tools will increasingly depend on model capabilities, developer experiences, and ecosystem synergy. True breakthroughs in intelligence may stem from AI's self-evolution capabilities rather than surpassing single technical metrics.

以下是关于GitHub CEO托马斯·多姆克访谈内容的总结，涵盖AI编程领域的竞争、技术发展及未来趋势：

---

### **1. AI编程领域的竞争格局**  
- **行业竞争激烈**：AI编程助手是当前AI领域竞争最激烈的细分市场之一，多家公司如Cursor、Lovable、Windsurf等快速崛起，形成激烈竞争。  
- **GitHub Copilot的定位**：尽管GitHub Copilot是最早进入AI编程助手领域的产品，但近年来面临部分用户群体的关注度下降。多姆克认为，AI代码生成正处于创新浪潮的前沿，竞争的核心在于模型能力的提升和开发者体验的优化。  
- **Cursor的差异化策略**：Cursor通过重新设计IDE（集成开发环境），打造“AI原生”的工作流，而非简单地将AI作为附加功能嵌入传统IDE。这种创新使其在行业中保持领先。  
- **多模型选择的重要性**：多姆克强调，开发者工具应提供多模型选择权，允许用户根据需求自由切换模型（如GPT-3.5、Claude Sonnet等），而非由平台强制决定。这一理念成为AI编程领域竞争的关键。

---

### **2. GitHub Copilot的市场地位与挑战**  
- **用户增长显著**：GitHub Copilot目前拥有2000万用户，同比增长75%，覆盖90家财富100强企业。VS Code上的用户数达5500万，显示其广泛的市场渗透。  
- **技术迭代与挑战**：GitHub Copilot在从单模态到多模态的转型上起步较晚（2023年10月引入AIC支持），但多姆克认为，真正考验企业的是面对压力时的韧性，而非短期的炒作热度。  
- **生态系统的角色**：GitHub既是竞争者，也是整个AI编程生态的一部分。其与微软、OpenAI的合作（如Copilot的诞生）推动了行业创新，同时从生态系统的规模增长中受益。

---

### **3. 微软与OpenAI的合作进展**  
- **企业关系调整**：微软与OpenAI正在商讨新的企业合作模式，因OpenAI从非营利机构转为营利机构，微软作为重要股东（拥有IP独家访问权）需确保合作的互惠性。  
- **合作的历史与未来**：最初Copilot的诞生依赖OpenAI的GPT-3和Codex模型，以及微软的基础设施与AI经验。多姆克认为，这种合作模式将继续推动行业创新，并可能吸引更多竞争者加入。

---

### **4. 对AGI（通用人工智能）与超级智能的看法**  
- **模糊的定义**：多姆克认为，AGI或超级智能（ASI）的定义尚不清晰，且在实际应用中未必重要（除非合同规定或作为营销工具）。  
- **关键在于自我提升能力**：他提出，AGI的标志性时刻是AI实现自我进化，例如模型无需人工干预即可从GPT-4跃迁至GPT-5，或像人类一样从“被笑话逗笑”到“自己讲笑话”。  
- **人类认可的智能**：真正的智能应具备持续自我进化和提升的能力，而非单纯解决特定问题。这与人类认知的动态性相呼应。

---

### **5. 行业趋势与未来展望**  
- **开发者数量与需求增长**：软件开发只会越来越多，开发者人数也在持续增加，推动工具和平台的不断迭代。  
- **技术演进的不确定性**：AI编程领域的竞争和技术进步速度极快，模型能力（如Claude Sonnet、Llama系列）可能随时变化，行业格局也可能随之调整。  
- **工具与开发者协同**：Anthropic的Claude Sonnet之所以在编码领域领先，关键在于其对“工具使用”的训练，即模型能像开发者一样合理调用各种工具（如安装NPM包）。这一能力成为Agent模式的核心。

---

### **总结**  
托马斯·多姆克的访谈揭示了AI编程领域的快速演进：从GitHub Copilot的市场挑战到Cursor的创新设计，从微软与OpenAI的合作到对AGI的哲学思考。未来，AI编程工具的竞争将更依赖模型能力、开发者体验以及生态系统的协同，而真正的智能突破可能源于AI的自我进化能力，而非单一技术指标的超越。
