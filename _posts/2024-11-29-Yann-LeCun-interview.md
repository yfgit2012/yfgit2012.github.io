## Yann LeCun's interview with Nikhil Kamath

Here is the translation:

The interview mainly discussed the importance of artificial intelligence, especially open-source platforms and language models in future development. Yang Lixin mentioned his giant language model (LLAMA) and its capabilities such as modeling, processing long-sequence text data, and capturing complex relationships between words.

He emphasized that language models can more deeply understand and generate text rather than simply predicting the next letter or word.

Yang Lixin also discussed his view on artificial intelligence as goal-driven AI (System 2), which is different from the reactive AI represented by large language models (System 1). Goal-driven AI can make more thoughtful plans, reason, predict the results of actions, and adjust strategies based on results. This is closer to human thought and decision-making processes.

Yang Lixin also talked about the importance of open-source platforms in future AI development. He believes that open-source platforms will become a mainstream trend because they have advantages such as portability, flexibility, security, and low cost. This will greatly change the way humans interact with technology, for example, through devices like smart glasses to get AI assistance.

For young people in India, Yang Lixin suggested several proposals, including pursuing doctoral or master's degrees to deeply learn AI technologies. He believes that higher education can train young people to invent new things, ensuring that their methods are scientific and innovative.

For young people who want to start a business in the AI field, Yang Lixin advises choosing open-source foundation models like LLAMA, then fine-tuning them for specific vertical applications. For example, there is great potential in areas such as law, accounting, business information, education auxiliary tools, and healthcare.

Finally, Yang Lixin talked about his active presence on social networks and how he feels like a complete fool in some circles. However, he still hopes that his views can provide inspiration to others and encourages them to watch the original video for more information.

#### Translation 

这个访谈主要讨论了人工智能领域尤其是开源平台和语言模型在未来发展中的重要性。杨立昆提到了他所创立的巨型语言模型(LLAMA)及其能力建模、处理长序列文本数据、捕捉文本中单词之间复杂关系等功能。他强调了语言模型能够更深入地理解和生成文本，而不是简单地预测下一个字母或词汇。

杨立昆还提到了他对人工智能领域的另一种看法，即目标驱动的人工智能(System 2)，与大语言模型所代表的反应式人工智能(System 1)不同。目标驱动的人工智能能够进行更为深思熟虑的计划和推理，预测这些动作的结果，并根据结果调整策略。这更接近人类的思维和决策过程。

杨立昆也谈到了他对开源平台在未来人工智能发展中的重要性。他认为开源平台将成为主流趋势，因为它具有可移植性、灵活性、安全性和低成本等优势。这将极大地改变人类与技术的交互方式，例如通过智能眼镜等设备来获取人工智能的帮助。

对于印度年轻人，杨立昆提出了几些建议，包括攻读博士学位或硕士学位深入学习人工智能技术。他认为高等学位的学习过程能够训练年轻人发明新事物的能力，确保他们所使用的方法具有科学性和创新性。

对于想要在人工智能领域创业的年轻人，杨立昆建议选择利用开源基础模型，如LLAMA等，然后针对特定垂直应用进行微调。例如，在法律、会计、商业信息、教育辅助工具、医疗保健等领域都有着巨大的潜力。

最后，杨立昆谈到了自己在社交网络上的活跃性和在某些圈子里被认为是个十足的傻瓜的感受。然而，他仍然希望他的观点能带给大家一些启发，并鼓励大家去看原视频收获更多信息。
