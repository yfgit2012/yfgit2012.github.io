He mentioned that internal communication is crucial when rapidly growing, ensuring employees understand the company's long-term goals and can plan reasonable short-term work. For talent recruitment, he emphasized establishing a high-standard talent acquisition system to attract top talents across all age groups.

He also expressed his concerns about the future development of AI, believing its complexity will be a challenge involving computing power, supply chain, research direction, and product strategy. Altman said he dislikes comparing AI with the internet or electricity because AI is even more complex.

Finally, he predicted that over the next five years, AI technology will progress very quickly but social changes will be relatively small. However, in the next ten years, Altman believes the long-term impact of AI technology will gradually become apparent, leading to significant social change.
