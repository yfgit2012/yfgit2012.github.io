<document>
This article is about an interview with Sam Altman, discussing topics such as AI technology, chip supply chain issues, and regulatory problems. It mentions controversy over OpenAI's support for export controls, with Sam Altman explaining that the called-for regulations are primarily aimed at advanced models to establish safe testing standards. He also talked about a trend in AI programming towards automating code-writing work.

The article also discussed the issue of defining AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), with Sam Altman believing there is no unified standard definition for AGI yet, but that OpenAI may have already achieved it through enabling AI to complete specific tasks and plan intermediate steps to achieve a goal. The host Ben Thompson thought that an AI capable of completing specific tasks and planning intermediate steps could be considered a form of AGI.

Finally, Sam Altman gave advice to soon-to-graduate high school students, saying that in the age of AI, it is essential to master using AI tools, just as people were previously encouraged to be proficient in programming. He also emphasized the importance of cultivating resilience and adaptability, learning to understand others' needs, and making oneself useful to others.

Overall, this article provides insights into Sam Altman's and OpenAI's views on AI technology and their perspectives, offering readers something to think about.</document>

这篇文章是关于 Sam Altman 的访谈内容，讨论了 AI 技术、芯片供应链、监管问题等方面的问题。其中提到了 OpenAI 支持出口管制引发的争议，Sam Altman 解释说呼吁的监管主要是针对前沿模型，以建立安全的测试标准。他还谈到了 AI 编程的一个趋势，即将实现自动化编写代码工作的目标。

文章也提到了 AGI 的定义问题，Sam Altman 认为目前 AGI 并没有统一的标准定义，但 OpenAI 有可能已经实现了 AGI，尤其是通过让 AI 完成特定的任务，并且通过规划中间步骤实现目标。主持人本·汤普森认为能够完成特定的任务并且通过规划中间步骤实现目标的 AI 就可以看作是 AGI的一种体现。

最后，Sam Altman 给即将毕业的高中生们提了一些建议，他认为，在 AI 时代，要非常擅长使用 AI 工具，就像过去大家都说要精通编程一样。同时要注意培养自己的韧性和适应能力，学会了解别人的需求，以及如何让自己变得对他人有用。

总体来说，这篇文章提供了关于 Sam Altman 和 OpenAI 的观点，以及他们对 AI 技术的看法，希望能给读者一些新的思考。
