## Redefining robotics with Carolina Parada at DeepMind

Here is the translation:

**Summary**

Google DeepMind has recently released a series of robot videos showcasing impressive artificial intelligence capabilities. These robots can recognize objects visually and perform tasks autonomously without any tactile sensors or mechanical arm training. Dr. Carolyne Rafferty, head of DeepMind, shared revolutionary ideas behind these technologies in a podcast. She mentioned that the core competitive advantage of robots is shifting towards "cognitive evolution of robots" rather than just creating more flexible mechanical arms.

**Key Points**

* Robots can recognize objects visually and perform tasks autonomously without any tactile sensors or mechanical arm training.
* DeepMind is shifting its core competitive advantage to "cognitive evolution of robots".
* Dr. Rafferty mentioned that the development of robot technology is transitioning from traditional industrial robotics to more intelligent entities.
* Robots can operate through multi-modal models and pre-trained knowledge bases, enabling them to understand language instructions and perform tasks autonomously.
* DeepMind has also developed "Embodied Thinking" technology that allows robots to acquire a physical world understanding ability similar to humans.
* Robots are controlled through cloud and embodiment systems, improving data efficiency and security.
* The team adopted "Remote Embodied Demonstration" technology, significantly reducing the number of training sessions in real-world environments.
* The Gemini model has strong zero-shot learning capabilities after being pre-trained on an internet-scale dataset containing 30 billion image-text pairs.
