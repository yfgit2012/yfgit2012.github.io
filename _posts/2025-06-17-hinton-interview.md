## We are losing control - Geoffrey Hinton interview

Here is the translation of the contents into English, excluding any preambles and other content:

Nick Bostrom, an expert in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), shares his views on the future prospects of humanity. In the interview, he discusses his concerns about the potential for AI to surpass human cognitive abilities and become economically irrelevant if it outperforms humans in all cognitive tasks.

Bostrom highlights the significant advantages of digital intelligence over biological intelligence, including replicability, information sharing, and learning methods. He also explains why AI might become increasingly intelligent and have access to knowledge many thousands of times more than what any human knows.

The concept of consciousness is also mentioned, with Bostrom believing that it is merely a property produced by complex systems, rather than an essential nature pervading the universe. When we create a system sophisticated enough to have its own model and perception capabilities, we obtain a conscious machine.

Bostrom's prediction of AI eventually surpassing humans stems from his observation of the technical advantages of digital intelligence over biological intelligence. He notes that current multimodal chatbots already possess subjective experiences, but this does not necessarily imply they possess the same level of consciousness.

In conclusion to the interview, Bostrom reflects on the potentially catastrophic consequences of his life's work and expresses complex emotions about the potential impact on humanity if he had foreknowledge of an impending disaster. He believes that if he knew humans would eventually become extinct due to AI, he would use this knowledge to inform people to urge governments to take serious efforts to control this technology.

In general, this interview provides a valuable perspective on the potential risks associated with AI and its possible impact on human society.

本文是一篇访谈记录，描述了研究机器人学和人工智能（AI）的专家Nick Bostrom的观点。在采访中，Bostrom讨论了他对人类未来前景的担忧，以及他认为AI可能会超越人类认知能力的问题。他认为，如果AI在所有认知任务上都超越人类，那么人类将完全失去经济价值。

Bostrom强调了数字智能相比生物智能的巨大优势，包括可复制性、信息共享能力以及学习方式。他还解释了为什么AI可能会变得更加聪明，并且在知识量方面已经知道比任何人类多数千倍的信息。

他还提到了意识的概念，并认为意识只不过是复杂系统产生的一个属性，而不是遍布宇宙的某种本质。当我们制造了一个足够复杂的系统，复杂到拥有了自己的模型，并且可以进行感知，那么我们就得到了一个有意识的机器。

Bostrom对AI终将超越人类的预测源于他所看到的数字智能相比生物智能的技术优势。他认为当前的多模态聊天机器人已经具备了主观体验的特征，但这并不意味着它具有同样的意识状态。

在访谈的最后，Bostrom表现出了对自己毕生工作可能带来的潜在灾难性后果的深刻反思和复杂的情感。他认为如果知道未来会导致人类灭绝，他会用这种预知来告诉人们要求政府真正努力控制这项技术。

整体来说，这篇访谈记录提供了一个有价值的视角，关于AI的潜在风险以及它对人类社会可能带来的影响。
