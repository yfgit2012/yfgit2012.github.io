## Cursor core team: About AI coding

**Summary**

The Cursor team recently released an internal discussion video that delves into the current challenges and breakthrough directions in the field of reinforcement learning. They point out that reinforcement learning in the programming domain has a fundamental difference from other fields like mathematics or writing. In programming, reasoning itself is embedded within the answer, unlike mathematics where one can arrive at the correct answer step by step. The team also highlights an important limitation of current reinforcement learning methods, which is that most reinforcement learning is done to complete a set of test cases rather than the model's performance in actual scenarios.

**Main Points**

1.  **Challenges in Programming Reinforcement Learning**: The Cursor team notes that programming reinforcement learning has a fundamental difference from other fields like mathematics or writing. Reasoning itself is embedded within the answer, unlike mathematics where one can arrive at the correct answer step by step.
2.  **Optimizing Multi-Step Tool Invocation Process**: The need to optimize the entire multi-step tool invocation process rather than single outputs makes reinforcement learning more complex and challenging.
3.  **Limitations of Current Reinforcement Learning Methods**: Most reinforcement learning is done for completing a set of test cases rather than the model's performance in actual scenarios, which will lead to programming AI lacking understanding of human demands.
4.  **Observe User Behavior for Real Signals**: The team proposed an idea of observing user actual changes then based on this judging if the model makes it like or not, which would get true meaningful reward signals.
5.  **Future Programming AI Will Be More Intelligent**: They predict that future programming AI will use more tokens and make continuous tool calls before making decisions for a long time. This seems wasteful as many contents in the next iteration need to be recalculated. This means future programming AI needs higher computational resources.
6.  **Token Output Expansion Also Makes Training More Efficient**: For large language models training, high-quality data is more scarce than computing power but also limited, making future programming AI need better algorithms and computational resources for training.
7.  **Experiencing Programming Paradigm Shift**: From manually writing each line of code and gradually debugging, testing repeatedly to being gradually replaced by cooperative programming assisted by AI.

**Summary**

Cursor团队最近发布了一段内部讨论视频，深入探讨了强化学习领域当前挑战和突破方向。他们指出编程领域的强化学习与数学或写作等其他领域有根本性的差异。在编程中推理本身就嵌入在答案里，而不是像数学那样可以逐步到达正确答案。在强化学习中，需要优化整个多步骤工具调用过程，而不是单一的输出。团队还提到了当前强化学习方法的一个重要局限，那就是大多数强化学习都是为了完成一堆测试用例，而不是模型在实际场景中的表现。

1.  **编程领域的强化学习挑战**: Cursor团队指出编程领域的强化学习与数学或写作等其他领域有根本性的差异。推理本身就嵌入在答案里，而不是像数学那样可以逐步到达正确答案。
2.  **多步骤工具调用过程**: 需要优化整个多步骤工具调用过程，而不是单一的输出。这使得强化学习变得更加复杂和挑战。
3.  **当前强化学习方法局限性**: 大多数强化学习都是为了完成一堆测试用例，而不是模型在实际场景中的表现。团队认为这将导致编程AI缺乏理解人类需求的能力。
4.  **观察用户行为来获得真实信号**: 团队提出了一个想法，那就是观察用户实际做出的真实更改，然后根据这个来判断模型做得像不像。这将能够获得真正有意义的奖励信号。
5.  **未来的编程AI将变得更加智能**: 他们预计未来编程AI会使用更多token，并且会在做决定前连续调用工具很长时间。但是这样做似乎会浪费，因为很多内容在下次又得重新算一遍。这意味着未来的编程AI将需要更高效的计算资源。
6.  **输出token的扩展也会让训练变得更加高效**: 对于大语言模型的训练来说，高质量的数据比算力更加稀缺，但是最好的数据都是很有限的。这意味着未来的编程AI将需要更有效的算法和计算资源来进行训练。
7.  **正在经历编程范式转换**: 从手动编写每一行代码逐步调试，反复测试的方式到逐渐被 AI 辅助的协作式编程所取代。
