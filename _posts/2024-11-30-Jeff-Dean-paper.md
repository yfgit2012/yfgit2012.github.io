## Jeff Dean 's reaction to AlphaChip

Here are the contents translated into English, excluding any preambles and other unnecessary information:

1. AlphaChip uses reinforcement learning to design chip layouts, whereas the Caltech paper did not perform pre-training.
2. Jeff Dean points out that the omission of pre-training in the Caltech paper, along with reduced GPU numbers and insufficient training, led to performance decline.
3. Training with a large number of GPUs accelerates convergence speed and improves final quality, as reported in the original paper.
4. The reinforcement learning method in the Caltech paper did not reach convergence, whereas standard practice is to train until steady-state is achieved.
5. The TPU block results reported in the original paper were obtained from nodes with a technology node smaller than 7nm, while the Caltech paper used older 45nm and 12nm technology nodes.

Note: A conclusion was mentioned at the end of the article, stating that the AlphaChip open-source project is fully reproducible, with source code and binary files publicly available, but no problems or commercial conflicts were proven.

#### Translation 

文章讨论了一个名为AlphaChip的开源项目，针对一些批评和反驳Nature原论文中相关研究结果的回应。主要内容包括：

1. AlphaChip使用强化学习方法进行芯片布局设计，而加州大学论文未进行预训练。
2. Jeff Dean指出，加州大学论文中的预训练缺失、GPU数量减少以及训练不足导致性能下降。
3. 原论文中使用大量GPU的训练可加快收敛速度和提高最终质量。
4. 加州大学论文中强化学习方法未达到收敛状态，训练到平稳状态是标准做法。
5. 原论文中报告的TPU块结果来自小于7nm的技术节点，而加州大学论文采用了较旧的45nm和12nm技术节点。

文章结尾提到AlphaChip开源项目完全可复现，源代码和二进制文件公开，但未能证明任何问题或商业利益冲突。
