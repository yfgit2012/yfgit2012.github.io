## Anthropic 5-hour interview by Lex Fridman

Here is the translation:

<document>This article describes a discussion between the two chief product officers of OpenAI and Anthropic about the current state and future trends of artificial intelligence (AI) products. They talked about how models are becoming increasingly intelligent in understanding user needs and behavior patterns, and how asynchronicity will be a highly promising direction for future AI products.

They emphasized that current AI products mainly exist as passive response tools, but future AI will be able to more deeply participate in users' work and lives. Models can identify valuable information and trends from emails, provide important information summaries, and send meeting reminders based on user-granted permissions.

Asynchronicity is another key point, which allows users to give complex tasks to the AI without needing immediate feedback. The model can take some time to think, research, or interact with other systems or data sources to get more information, then give an initial answer, followed by further verification and optimization.

Kevin fully agrees with Mike's perspective, believing it's because the intelligence level of models is accelerating development. He also shared exciting developments in interaction modes, such as advanced voice patterns, real-time translation, and emotional accompaniment and social potential between users and models.

The article finally emphasizes that product managers need to keep up with these trends, constantly optimizing product design to meet users' dual demands for functionality and emotion.</document>

这篇文章描述了OpenAI和Anthropic两位首席产品官对人工智能（AI）产品现状和发展趋势的讨论。他们谈到了模型越来越智能地理解用户需求和行为模式，以及异步性成为未来AI产品的一个极具潜力的发展方向。

他们强调，当前的AI产品主要以被动响应的工具形式存在，但未来的AI将能够更深入地参与到用户的工作和生活中。模型可以根据用户授予的权限，从邮件中识别出有价值的信息和趋势，并提供重要信息总结和会议提醒。

异步性是另一个关键点，它允许用户向AI下达复杂任务，而不需要即时反馈。模型可以花费一定时间进行思考、研究甚至与其他系统或数据源交互，以获取更多信息，然后给出第一份答案，之后再进行进一步验证和优化。

凯文对迈克的观点表示完全认同，并认为这都是因为模型的智能化程度在加速发展。此外，他分享了当前模型在交互方式上的令人兴奋的发展成果，比如高级语音模式、实时翻译，以及用户与模型之间的情感陪伴和社交领域的潜在价值。

文章最后强调，产品经理需要紧跟这些趋势，不断优化产品设计来满足用户在功能和情感上的双重需求。
