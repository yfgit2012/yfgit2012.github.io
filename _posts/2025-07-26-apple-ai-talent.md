## Apple Is Losing Ground in the AI Talent War

Apple's AI team is in turmoil due to internal conflicts and strategic disagreements, leading to significant talent loss. The open-source initiative was rejected by senior management, sparking a conflict between the foundational model team and the software team. Pang Rongming left due to strategic disagreements, joining Meta, and his team members also left, causing a talent drain in Apple's AI field. Apple's leadership lacks a clear plan for AI, resulting in project delays, resource allocation conflicts, and declining team morale. The delayed release of the new Siri in 2025 further undermines team confidence, exposing Apple's chaotic AI strategy. Apple needs to reassess its strategy and stabilize its team to compete in AI.  
Key points: 1. Conflict between foundational model team and software team; 2. Key talent exodus (Pang Rongming, Tom Gunter, etc.); 3. Disagreements over open-source initiatives and strategy; 4. AI project delays and resource allocation conflicts; 5. Unclear leadership strategy causing research direction confusion; 6. Apple's brand influence cannot compensate for talent and technical shortcomings.
