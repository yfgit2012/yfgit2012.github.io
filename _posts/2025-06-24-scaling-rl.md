## Scaling Reinforcement Learning: Environments, Reward Hacking, Agents, Scaling Data

Here is the translation:

**Key Points:**

*   OpenAI is secretly training a new model that falls between GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.5.
*   The size of the new model is not the only consideration; OpenAI will leverage reinforcement learning as the core driving force to achieve more specific task capabilities.
*   Reinforcement learning becomes an interconnected closed loop in reasoning and training processes, enabling models to continuously iterate and update.
*   The AI industry is undergoing a shift from brute-force computation to intelligent optimization, with the rise of reinforcement learning signifying a move from training a omniscient model to cultivating an intelligent entity that can evolve sustainably within specific environments.

**关键点：**

*   OpenAI正在秘密训练一个新的模型，该模型介于GPT-4.1和GPT-4.5之间。
*   新模型的规模并非是唯一考虑因素，OpenAI将强化学习作为核心驱动力，以实现更具体的任务能力。
*   强化学习在推理和训练过程中成为一个相互依赖的闭环，使得模型能够持续迭代和更新。
*   AI行业正在经历从蛮力计算向智能优化的转型，并且强化学习的崛起意味着我们正在从训练一个无所不知的模型转向培养一个能够在特定环境中持续进化的智能体。
