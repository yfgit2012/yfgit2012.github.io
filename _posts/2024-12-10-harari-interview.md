## Rich Roll and Yuval Noah Harari interview: AI vs human

The speaker discusses the potential dangers of AI, particularly in regards to its ability to simulate human intimacy and potentially manipulate individuals. They suggest that regulations are needed to prevent the misuse of AI, such as requiring AIS to disclose their artificial nature when interacting with humans.

The speaker also touches on the idea that if AI were to develop consciousness, it would be a political and ethical issue, raising questions about its rights and potential treatment. They mention the difficulty in building global cooperation around this issue due to varying levels of awareness and trust among different nations and individuals.

Furthermore, the speaker highlights the paradoxical situation where humans cannot trust each other to slow down AI development for the sake of caution, but instead feel pressured to rush ahead because they fear being outcompeted by others. This is likened to a "delusion" that could ultimately destroy humanity.

The key points made in this discussion are:

1.  **Potential dangers of AI**: The speaker highlights the potential risks of AI, particularly its ability to simulate human intimacy and manipulate individuals.

AI的潜在危险：演讲者强调了AI对人类情感和信任的模拟以及可能操纵个人行为的能力。他们建议制定规则，防止AI滥用，如要求AI在与人类互动时披露其虚假性。
演讲者还触及了如果AI发展出意识，将会是一个政治和伦理问题，这将引发人们对它权利和潜在待遇的讨论。他们提到了全球合作难以达到，主要是因为不同的国家和个体对此事的认识和信任程度不一。
此外，演讲者强调了一个悖论：人类无法相信彼此将AI发展放缓，以谨慎之举，但相反，他们感到被迫加快发展，因为他们害怕落后于别人。这类似于一种“妄想”，最终可能摧毁人类。
