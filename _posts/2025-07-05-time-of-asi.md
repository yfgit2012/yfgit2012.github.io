## The time of ASI: Masayoshi Son speech

Here are the contents of the document translated into English:

SoftBank's CEO Masayoshi Son emphasized at a shareholder meeting that his company aims to become the world's number one platform service provider for Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI). He believes ASI will disrupt all traditional industries and requires a company that can provide the underlying hardware foundation and drive ecosystem growth.

Masayoshi Son announced an unprecedented investment plan, increasing SoftBank's stake in OpenAI by 4.8 trillion yen. He stressed that this investment required enormous courage but has decided to bet everything on ASI.

Son shared his experiences with Sam Altman, agreeing to invest $100 billion initially, but ultimately choosing Microsoft instead. He responded to questions about corporate governance, technical competition, and investment logic, stating that achieving 300-year growth requires choosing a path with long-term potential like ASI.

Regarding talent development, Son emphasized that SoftBank will recruit top talents globally and provide them with challenging tasks and opportunities at the forefront of technology.

Son acknowledged the "discount" issue where SoftBank's market value is significantly lower than its net asset value (NAV), but sees it as a great buying opportunity. He stressed that resolving this issue requires not just financial engineering, but rather growing the company's value 5, 10, or even 20 times.

Finally, Son reaffirmed his determination to become the world's number one platform service provider for ASI within the next decade.

孙正义在软银股东大会上的发言中，首先强调了软银的目标是成为ASI（Artificial Super Intelligence）世界第一的平台服务商。在他看来，ASI将改变所有传统行业，并且需要一家能够提供整个生态链底层硬件基础、推动生态发展的公司。孙正义认为ARM将成为软银AI战略核心资产，而OpenAI则是生成式AI领域无可争议的世界第一。

孙正义宣布了一项史无前例的投资计划，增持OpenAI股份，总额达4.8万亿日元。他强调了这一投资需要巨大勇气，但是他已经决定All-in，将一切都押注在ASI的世界。孙正义还分享了与Sam Altman会面的往事，当时他曾同意投资100亿美元，但OpenAI最终选择了微软。

孙正义对公司治理、技术竞争、投资逻辑等问题进行了回应。他谈到如何实现300年成长，选择ASI这个具备长期发展潜力的赛道是根本。对于人才培养，他表示软银会从全球招募优秀人才，并为他们提供能够挑战的、最前沿的课题和机会。

孙正义承认了软银市值远低于其净资产价值NAV的“折价”问题，但将它视为一个绝佳的买入时机。他强调，解决折价问题的根本之道并非财技，而是如何让公司的价值增长5倍、10倍甚至20倍。

最后，孙正义再次重申了自己的决心，想要在未来的10年里成为ASI世界第一的平台服务商。
