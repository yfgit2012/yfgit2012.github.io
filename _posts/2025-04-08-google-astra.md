## Google Project Astra

**Summary**

Google has rolled out Project Astra in Gemini Live, which brings real-time visual AI to mobile devices. The feature allows users to have multilingual conversations about anything seen and heard via a phone's camera or screen sharing. This technology is available on Pixel 9 and Samsung Galaxy S25 devices, with Galaxy S25 owners getting the feature without an additional subscription.

The feature provides advanced camerabased analysis and expanded AIdriven interactions. Users can ask Gemini Live to analyze how many fingers they are holding up or identify what street they are on as their car passes through a city. However, early users have noted that the feature behaves more like a snapshot tool than a continuous live feed.

Additionally, Google has introduced screen sharing capabilities in Gemini, allowing users to share their screen and let the AI see whatever they are looking at. This can be useful for getting instant feedback on news articles, product comparisons, or discount codes.
