## Interview with MSFT CTO Kevin Scott

This is an interview, mainly about the application and future trend of AI in programming. Kevin Scott believes that AI is changing the way people program, helping programmers complete many automated tasks, and predicts that higher levels of abstraction may appear in the future, which will allow developers to focus more on "building vision", "thinking about the overall architecture and development direction" of products, rather than just coding.
