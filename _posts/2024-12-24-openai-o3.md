## OpenAI o3 model

It seems like there is no specific question or task provided in the given text. The text appears to be a presentation or speech about an AI model, specifically "03 mini" and its capabilities, features, and safety testing processes.

However, if we were to extract some questions or tasks based on the content, here are a few possibilities:

1. **What is the performance of 03 mini compared to other models?**

Answer: According to the presentation, 03 mini achieves comparable better performance than O1 mini medium in certain tasks and drastically reduces latency.

2. **How can I apply for safety testing of 03 mini as a researcher or security expert?**

Answer: You can visit the company's website and fill out a form (which is shown on the screen) to apply for early access to the model for safety testing.

3. **What is deliberative alignment, and how does it improve safety performance?**

Answer: Deliberative alignment is a new technique that leverages the reasoning capabilities of AI models to find a more accurate safety boundary. It allows the model to reason over a prompt and determine whether it's safe or not, often uncovering hidden intentions or tricks.
