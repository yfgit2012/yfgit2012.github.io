## GPT-4.5 and GPT 5 outlook

Here is the translation of the contents into English:

This article is a blog by Sam Altman, co-founder of Kubernetes and Cloud Native Computing Foundation. The content focuses on the impact of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) on human society.

Altman believes AGI will be the most powerful lever in history, greatly amplifying human subjective power without diminishing individual influence. This change may lead to minimal industry disruption, but scientific progress could be faster than today and even surpass all other changes brought by AGI.

Over time, prices of many goods will plummet as smart costs and energy costs are the main limiting factors for many industries. However, prices of luxury items and scarce resources like land may skyrocket. Altman emphasizes that the path to developing AGI is relatively clear, but how to integrate AGI into society, public policy, and social consensus will be crucial.

This is why we're constantly releasing AI products early and frequently, so that society can evolve with technology and be prepared for the future.

Altman expects everything to become intelligent, and many people believe individuals should have more control over technology, such as open-source measures, while also finding a balance between security and individual empowerment.

Ensuring widespread benefits from AGI is crucial. From history, technological progress has improved health outcomes, economic prosperity, and other key indicators.

However, Altman reminds us that technology itself won't automatically lead to greater equality. If we want to do better on social fairness, we may need new ways of thinking, especially concerning the balance of power between capital and labor, which could be broken by AGI and require early intervention.

Ultimately, Altman hopes that by 2035, everyone will have access to an intelligence resource equivalent to the collective human intelligence of the entire world in 2025.

这篇文章是Sam Altman（Kubernetes和Cloud Native Computing基金会联合创始人）的博客，内容主要围绕Artificial General Intelligence（AGI）对人类社会的影响展开。Altman认为AGI将是一个史上最强大的杠杆，能够极大地增强人类的主观能动性，而不会削弱个人的影响力。这一改变可能会导致一些行业变化不大，但科学进步的速度可能比今天快得多，甚至可能超越AGI带来的所有其他变革。

长期来看，许多商品的价格将大幅下降，因为智能成本和能源成本是许多行业的主要限制因素。然而，奢侈品和一些稀缺资源，如土地的价格可能反而会飙升。Altman强调AGI的发展道路相对清晰，但如何将AGI融入社会、公共政策和社会共识将起到至关重要的作用。这也是为什么我们不断尽早、频繁推出AI产品的原因之一，为了让社会与技术共同演进，为未来做好准备。

Altman认为，我们会期待一切都变得智能化，面对这个趋势，许多人认为应该给予个人更多对技术的控制权，如开放源码等措施，同时也要接受在安全性与个体赋权之间找到平衡。确保AGI的广泛受益，让AGI的好处惠及全社会至关重要，从历史来看，科技进步通常会改善健康状况、经济繁荣等关键指标。

然而，Altman也提醒我们，技术本身不会自动带来更大的平等，如果希望在社会公平方面做得更好，我们可能需要新的思维方式。尤其值得关注的是，资本与劳动力之间的力量平衡可能会被打破，这可能需要及早干预。

最终，Altman希望到2035年，每个人都能够调用相当于2025年全人类智慧总和的智力资源所有人都应当获得近乎无限的智能支持，并且自由地发挥想象力。
