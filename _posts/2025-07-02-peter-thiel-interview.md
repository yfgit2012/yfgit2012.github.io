**Main Content Introduction**

Recently, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft's AI capital expenditure plans have reached around $320 billion, a 46% increase from $223 billion in 2024, adding $97 billion to the total. However, most companies' additional revenue falls short of one-tenth of their investment, leading to growing concerns among investors about an AI bubble. Nevertheless, PayPal co-founder and billionaire Peter Thiel presented a contrarian view on the Interesting Times podcast that technology stagnation poses a more terrifying risk than AI.

**Key Points**

* Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft's combined AI capital expenditure plans total around $320 billion.
* The figure increased by 46% from $223 billion in 2024, adding $97 billion to the total.
* Most companies' additional revenue falls short of one-tenth of their investment.
* Peter Thiel believes that technology stagnation poses a more terrifying risk than AI.
* He presented a contrarian view that if humans cannot find a path to "return to the future," society will slowly disintegrate.
* He warns that if we are left with only AI, he will accept it because it's the only thing we're still trying to achieve.
* He is concerned about a "slow and unnoticeable collapse" rather than a catastrophic disaster caused by AI overnight.
* He thinks AI might be an opportunity but its emergence also represents a signal that we've made little progress in other areas of technology except for this one direction.
* He believes AI could be the only variable, but it may not be enough to change the situation.
