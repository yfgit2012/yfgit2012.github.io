**Summary**

The article discusses the top strategic technology trends for 2025, as predicted by Gartner. The trends include AI Agents, AI Governance Platforms, Disinformation Security, Post-Quantum Cryptography, Ambient Invisible Intelligence, Energy-Efficient Computing, Hybrid Computing, Space Computing, Polyfunctional Robots, and Neurological Enhancement. Each trend has the potential to deeply impact business operations and competitiveness, bringing new opportunities as well as challenges.

**Main Contents**

1. **AI Agents**: AI Agents refer to autonomous AI that can execute decisions and tasks based on set goals. This technology is expected to change human-AI interactions, with 15% of corporate decisions being led by AI Agents by 2028.
2. **AI Governance Platforms**: The importance of AI governance platforms cannot be overstated, as many companies lack the necessary framework for their AI systems. Gartner emphasizes that AI governance will be the foundation for successful AI adoption. These platforms help ensure models are fair, transparent, secure, and compliant with regulations, like IBM Watson's Open Governance.
3. **Disinformation Security**: The trend of disinformation security is crucial as AI-generated misinformation can pose significant threats. By 2028, half of enterprises will adopt this type of security service. Intel's FakeCatcher identifies fake content through facial expressions changes, and Zoom uses floating watermarks to prevent impersonation attacks.
4. **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: This trend involves moving beyond current encryption methods that are vulnerable to quantum computers. Google and CloudFlare are already testing post-quantum cryptography, with Gartner predicting its adoption will begin by 2029. This transition is not just about technology but also concerns data security and customer trust.
5. **Ambient Invisible Intelligence**: Ambient invisible intelligence involves sensors providing services without being intrusive. The trend includes AI-powered smart labels that can recognize and interact with various objects, enhancing the environment's intelligence without disrupting it.

**Key Points**

1. **AI Agents** will change how humans interact with AI.
2. **AI Governance Platforms** are essential for AI adoption to be successful.
3. **Disinformation Security** will become a major concern due to the rise of AI-generated misinformation.
4. **Post-Quantum Cryptography** is necessary to protect data against quantum computers.
5. **Ambient Invisible Intelligence** involves sensors and smart labels enhancing environmental intelligence without being intrusive.

6. **Energy-Efficient Computing** is crucial for resource competition, with companies investing in high-efficiency chips and cooling technologies.
7. **Hybrid Computing** combines local computing resources with cloud services to optimize performance and cost.
8. **Space Computing** involves virtual interactions that merge physical and digital worlds, enabling richer and more intuitive experiences.
9. **Polyfunctional Robots** are versatile machines capable of adapting to various environments and tasks, expanding their applications and value.
10. **Neurological Enhancement** includes technologies like brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for learning, stress management, attention training, and potential employee performance augmentation.

These trends have the potential to profoundly affect how businesses operate and compete, bringing new opportunities but also challenges that must be addressed proactively.
