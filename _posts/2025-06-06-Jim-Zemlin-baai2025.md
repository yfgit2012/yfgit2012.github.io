## Open Source AI Has Won : Why that's great for the world by Jim Zemlin (BAAI2025)

**Summary**

Open-source technology is crucial in artificial intelligence (AI), and its importance cannot be overstated. The Linux Foundation, which has more than just Linux under its umbrella, has been instrumental in bringing together industry leaders to collaborate on open-source software. China has heavily invested in open-source, and the country's government has implemented policies to encourage collaboration and sharing of open-source technology. In the United States, companies like IBM have used open-source software to compete with incumbents and create higher-level innovation.

Open-source AI economics is driving innovation faster, and the trend continues to accelerate. A recent study by McKenzie showed that 76% of organizations expect to deploy AI, open-source AI in their enterprise within several years. The value created from applications built using AI far exceeds the infrastructure that enables those applications. At the Linux Foundation, they want to see as much open-source infrastructure components as possible so that application developers and users can create amazing applications quickly.

**Summary**

开放源码技术在人工智能（AI）领域至关重要，不能被过低估计。Linux Foundation虽然拥有Linux，但其更为广泛的影响力，使其能够聚集业界领导者合作开发开源软件。中国已大力投资于开放源码，并实施了政策鼓励合作和分享开放源码技术。在美国，由IBM等公司使用开放源码软件与市场上占据优势的厂商竞争，催生出更高水平的创新。

开放源码人工智能经济学正在驱动创新速度越来越快。近期McKenzie的一项研究显示有76%的组织.expect到在几年内将其AI、开放源码AI部署于企业。通过AI构建应用所创造出的价值远高于使应用正常运作所需的基础设施。在Linux Foundation，他们希望看到尽可能多的开源基础结构组件，以便开发者和使用者可以快速地创建出惊人的应用。
