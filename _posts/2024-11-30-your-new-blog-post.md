Here is a summary of the contents in no more than 20% of the total length:\n\nThe story begins with the tale of "Unsinkable Sam", a cat that survived the sinking of the German battleship Bismarck and went on to serve as a ship\'s cat on several vessels. This anecdote serves as an introduction to the history of domestication of the modern house cat, which dates back over 10,000 years in the Fertile Crescent. Wildcats were drawn to grain stores that attracted rodents, and farmers tolerated their presence for pest control. As humans and cats interacted more, wildcats began to migrate with Neolithic farmers, eventually becoming essential sailing companions due to their ability to hunt vermin on ships. The Egyptians also domesticated their own local cats, which became revered for their hunting prowess and gained immortality in ancient art and culture. Over time, ship cats traveled across the globe, carrying the lineage of wildcats from Asia to Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. Despite centuries of coexistence with humans, modern house cats have undergone little genetic change and remain "wild animals" with fierce hunting instincts.
