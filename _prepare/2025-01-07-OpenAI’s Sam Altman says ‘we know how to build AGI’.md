## OpenAI’s Sam Altman says ‘we know how to build AGI’

Here are the contents summarized to no more than 50% of the total length:

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that the company knows "how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it." Altman made the announcement in a blog post discussing the past and future of OpenAI. The company's next goal is "superintelligence in the true sense of the word," which could massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation.

Altman's description of superintelligence sounds much like how OpenAI once described AGI, leading some to question whether this is just a rebranding effort. Microsoft classifies AGI as a system capable of generating $100 billion in profits, but reports suggest that loophole may not be effective.

OpenAI plans to blend its large language models together as an "AGI" offering, potentially to hit this goalpost faster. However, the company is currently losing money on its ChatGPT Pro subscriptions. Altman has consolidated power at OpenAI, which aims to transition from a nonprofit organization to a for-profit one this year.

OpenAI 首席执行官萨姆·阿尔特曼表示，公司已经知道如何“按传统方式”建设 AGI。 在一篇讨论OpenAI过去和未来博客文章中，阿尔特曼宣布了这一点。 该公司的下一个目标是实现 “真正”的超智能，这可能会大大加速科学发现和创新。

阿尔特曼对超智能的描述听起来与 OpenAI 曾经如何描述 AGI 相似，导致一些人质疑这是否只是重新命名努力。 微软将 AGI 视为一种能够产生 100 亿美元利润的系统，但报告表明这一漏洞可能不起作用。

OpenAI 打算将其大型语言模型混合在一起作为“AGI”产品，尽快实现这个目标。但是，公司当前正在以 ChatGPT Pro 订阅的速度亏损钱。阿尔特曼已集中了 OpenAI 的权力，该公司计划今年转变为营利组织。
