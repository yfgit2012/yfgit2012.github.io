**Summary**

Anthropic recently held its first developer conference. At this event, they announced the release of two new models: Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. These models were designed for coding, advanced reasoning, and AI Agent tasks.

**Key Points**

* Two new models, Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, were released for coding, advanced reasoning, and AI Agent tasks.
* The Opus 4 model is the world's strongest coding model, capable of solving complex programming problems and running independently for several hours.
* The Sonnet 4 model is lighter and faster, making it suitable for real-time response scenarios.
* Both models are hybrid, allowing them to switch between instant response and extended thinking modes while using tools during reasoning processes.
* Claude Opus 4 achieved a benchmark score of 72.5% on the SWE-bench test, surpassing Sonnet 3.7's 62.3%.
* The Opus 4 model is more powerful than its predecessors, with enhanced memory capabilities and the ability to create and maintain "memory files" for storing important information.
* Claude Code is a new tool that enables developers to utilize Claude in their IDEs (Vscode and Jetbrain) and provides an SDK for direct integration into programming projects.

Anthropic recently held its first developer conference, where it announced the release of Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, two new models designed for coding, advanced reasoning, and AI Agent tasks. The Opus 4 model is considered the world's strongest coding model, capable of handling complex programming problems and running autonomously for several hours. In contrast, the Sonnet 4 model is lighter and faster, making it suitable for real-time response scenarios. Both models are hybrid models that can switch between instant response and extended thinking modes, using tools during reasoning processes.
