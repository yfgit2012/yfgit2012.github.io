## Jeffrey Ullman Interview

Here is the translation:

<document>This article describes Jeffrey Erlman's views on education technology, seniors and adapting to new technologies, as well as possible future technologies that could change the world. He believes that although technology can improve teaching processes, it cannot replace teachers' roles in education, which are irreplaceable.

Erlman also mentions his personal struggles with adapting to new technologies, such as using car navigation systems and Google Maps. He has also experienced challenges faced by seniors - they need more time to adapt to new technologies, and even among peers there can be a large difference between individuals.

He thinks that considering society is rapidly aging, the tech industry should figure out how to incorporate seniors' preferences, needs, and differences. He also mentioned machine learning and big model technology, which can provide intent-based user interaction patterns for specific groups, thus helping users with different needs.

Finally, he expressed concern about research on human-computer interactions among the elderly as a good research topic. Although it may not change the world, it's still worth paying attention to. In contrast, he is more optimistic about quantum computing and general artificial intelligence, which have the potential to change the world. He doubts whether quantum computing follows Moore's Law and can double the number of available qubits every two years.

In short, this article shows Erlman's views on the rapid pace of technology development, seniors' adaptation challenges, and possible future technologies that could change the world. He believes we need to better understand and adapt to new technologies and consider the changes happening in society.</document>

这篇文章描述了杰弗里·厄尔曼对教育技术、老年人与新技术的适应以及未来可能改变世界的技术等主题的看法。他认为虽然技术可以改进教学流程，但它无法取代老师在教育中的作用，老师提供帮助和引导学生解决问题是不可替代的。

厄尔曼还提到，他个人对新技术的适应困难，比如使用车载导航系统与谷歌地图等。他也体会到了老年人的挑战——他们需要更多时间去适应新的技术，甚至在同龄人中个体之间也存在很大差异。

他认为，考虑到社会正在加速老龄化，科技行业应该弄清楚如何纳入老年人的偏好、需求和差异。他还提到了机器学习和大模型技术，可以为特定群体提供基于意图的用户交互范式，从而帮助不同需求的用户。

最后，他表示关注老年人的人机交互研究是一个不错的研究课题，虽然它可能不至于改变世界，但也值得去关注。相比之下，他更看好量子计算和通用人工智能，因为它们有可能改变世界的潜力。他怀疑量子计算是否遵循摩尔定律以及能否每两年将可用的量子比特数量翻倍。

总之，这篇文章展示了厄尔曼对技术发展速度、老年人的适应挑战和未来可能改变世界的技术等主题的看法。他认为我们需要更好地理解和适应新技术，以及考虑到社会正在发生的变化。
