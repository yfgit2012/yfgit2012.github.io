**Key Points**

* ChatGPT has become a super winner in the consumer-grade AI field, but its innovation results are still insufficient in its own field
* AI products lack traditional consumer products' user dynamics and social attributes, leading to stagnation
* Social networks in the internet era are established on UGC (User-Generated Content) and interpersonal relationship chains, while the AI field has yet to reinvigorate this sector

* Investors are concerned about the form of native AI social networks, believing that true social interactions require genuine emotional investment
* Companies' urgent demand for AI strategies has led them to actively capture blockbuster clues from consumer social platforms
* Another significant change brought by AI applications is a substantial increase in consumers' willingness to pay, with ChatGPT's business model quality far exceeding that of the previous generation's consumer products
* A structural shift has occurred in payment patterns, resulting in significantly improved repeat consumption and income retention rates
* In the AI era, enterprise adoption of new technologies is happening faster than on the consumer side
* Companies' urgent demand for AI strategies has led them to actively capture blockbuster clues from consumer social platforms

**Summary**

ChatGPT has become a super winner in the consumer-grade AI field, but its innovation results are still insufficient in its own field. Investors believe that AI products lack traditional consumer products' user dynamics and social attributes, leading to stagnation.
