## Domain specific AI agents (DXA) will shape the industrial world in the next 10 years

It seems like this is a transcript of a conversation between two individuals, likely experts in AI or machine learning. The discussion revolves around the potential of AI to solve complex problems and the challenges associated with it.

Some key points from the conversation are:

1. **Recurrent Neural Networks**: One speaker mentions that recurrent neural networks will become more prevalent as computing power increases, allowing for more efficient problem-solving.
2. **Expertise in LLMs (Large Language Models)**: Another speaker highlights the importance of domain-specific knowledge in AI models and suggests that incorporating human expertise can help overcome limitations.
3. **Overcoming Expert Disagreements**: The conversation touches on the challenge of reconciling disagreements between experts, even when they're interacting with a model. The solution proposed involves using machine learning to identify better versus worse outcomes, rather than correct versus incorrect ones.
4. **Capturing Domain Knowledge**: One speaker suggests leveraging existing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and recipes in semiconductor manufacturing as a way to capture domain knowledge.
5. **The Role of Human Experience**: Another speaker emphasizes the value of human experience and anecdotes in uncovering novel solutions, even when SOPs are available.

Overall, the conversation underscores the potential benefits and challenges of AI-driven problem-solving, as well as the importance of incorporating human expertise and experience to overcome limitations.
