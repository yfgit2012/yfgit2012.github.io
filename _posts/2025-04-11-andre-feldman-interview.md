1. In their early stages, companies don't need to have the best technology; just being good enough can help them occupy the market.

2. The AI industry is still in its early stage and has a lot of room for improvement in terms of data, computing power, and algorithms, providing more opportunities for investors.

3. Feldman believes that while NVIDIA currently dominates the market, it may decline to 50-60% within five years; he thinks NVIDIA's true moat lies in its market dominance and being the default solution, but its Achilles' heel is the incompatibility of GPU external memory with reasoning calculations.

4. Feldman thinks Cerebras has a certain technological advantage, maintaining high profit margins that reflect the high value-added products; Cerebras has refined its supply chain through its big deal with G42 but has paid a price in terms of exploring the Middle East market.

5. Feldman believes that underestimating China's AI development capabilities may have consequences; China has rich data resources and a massive talent reserve, making it an important advantage for its AI development.</document>

这篇访谈主要是Cerebras CEO安德鲁·费尔德曼对AI芯片领域的一些看法和观点。以下是总结：

1. 企业初期的技术并不需要是最顶尖的，只要达到“足够好用”的临界点就可以占据市场。

2. AI行业目前仍处于早期阶段，数据、算力、算法都有巨大的提升空间，这为投资者提供了更多机会。

3. 费尔德曼认为英伟达虽然现在占据着垄断地位，但未来五年可能会降至50%到60%，他觉得英伟达真正的护城河在于市场主导地位和默认解决方案，而致命软肋是GPU外接内存不适合推理计算。

4. 费尔德曼认为Cerebras有着一定的技术优势，保持了较高的毛利率体现了产品的高附加值。Cerebras在G42的大单中完成对供应链的淬炼，但是在中东市场的开拓上交了不少学费。

5. 费尔德曼认为美国对中国AI发展能力的低估可能会付出代价，中国有丰富的数据资源和庞大的人才储备，这是其AI发展的重要优势。
