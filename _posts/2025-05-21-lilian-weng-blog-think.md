## Lilian Weng: Why We Think

Here are the contents translated into English:

**Summary**

Lilian Weng's blog post "Why We Think" explores the issue of enabling machines to think more deeply. Lilian introduces various advanced methods and logic, including generating longer thought chains, using external tools, performing cyclic calculations in continuous space, and treating the thinking process as a latent variable to optimize.

**Summary (continued)**

Lilian also discusses diverse mechanisms such as thought chains, intelligent decoding strategies, and implicit thinking to effectively utilize "thinking time" and break through current AI performance bottlenecks. She introduces the concept of models dynamically determining the number of computation steps, as well as adding a cyclic block R on top of a standard Transformer.

**Summary (final)**

Lilian's blog post emphasizes that allowing models to invest additional computational resources during reasoning can significantly improve model performance, which is an aspect of introducing a new dimension for improving model intelligence. She also raises several open-ended questions, including how to incentivize models to produce human-readable and faithful reasoning paths in reinforced training, and how to define and capture reward cheating.

**Key Points**

* Enabling machines to think more deeply
* Generating longer thought chains, using external tools, performing cyclic calculations in continuous space, and optimizing thinking processes as latent variables
* Utilizing diverse mechanisms such as thought chains, intelligent decoding strategies, and implicit thinking to effectively utilize "thinking time"
* Models dynamically determining the number of computation steps
* Optimizing methods that treat testing-time thought steps as latent variables
* STaR method, which adds a rationalization process for failed attempts to resolve models' inability to receive learning signals
* Allowing models to invest additional computational resources during reasoning can significantly improve model performance
* Open-ended questions awaiting resolution
