This article mainly discusses Yang Lit Kun's latest interview content in the field of artificial intelligence. The article first introduces the huge success of large language models, which can process long sequences of text data and capture complex relationships between words through techniques such as multi-head attention, thereby achieving deep understanding and generation of text.

Yang Lit Kun advocates for a new architecture called Joint Embedding Prediction Architecture (JEPA) to solve the limitations of current artificial intelligence systems in understanding the physical world.

The article then introduces goal-driven artificial intelligence, also known as System 2, which can perform more deliberate planning and reasoning, such as planning a series of actions based on goals, predicting the results of these actions, and adjusting strategies based on results. This is closer to human thought and decision-making processes.

Regarding the future development of artificial intelligence, Yang Lit Kun believes that open-source platforms will dominate in the future. Open-source platforms have many advantages, such as portability, flexibility, security, and low cost, which will make them a mainstream trend in artificial intelligence.

The article also mentions Yang Lit Kun's advice to young people in India, encouraging them to pursue PhDs or master's degrees in computer science and AI. Higher education can train young people to invent new things, ensure that their methods have scientificity and innovativeness.

Finally, the article mentions Yang Lit Kun's advice to young entrepreneurs who want to start a business in the field of artificial intelligence. He suggests choosing open-source foundation models such as LLAMA, then fine-tuning them for specific vertical applications.

Yang Lit Kun also mentioned some ways that individuals can innovate in the field of AI, such as using AI to assist lawyers with case analysis and contract review, or using AI to provide medical assistance and help patients initially determine symptoms.
