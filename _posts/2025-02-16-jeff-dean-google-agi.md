In this interview, Jeff Dean and Noam Shazeer shared their 25-year experience working at Google, witnessing the company's growth from its early days to its current success, and seeing tremendous changes in the field of artificial intelligence. They discussed their work content, challenges, and achievements, as well as their vision for the future.

Jeff Dean mentioned the current challenges faced by Google, such as how to handle models with hundreds or thousands of billions of parameters, which requires loading the entire model into memory. He also discussed the possibility of using hybrid expert models in the future, which could be allocated more flexible memory resources based on the frequency and cost of usage.

Noam Shazeer talked about the issue of open research results, saying that Google has published many groundbreaking papers in the past, such as the Transformer paper, which have had a huge impact on the entire industry. However, he pointed out the challenge of balancing the publication of research results with maintaining competitiveness. He also emphasized the importance of humility and being able to let go of bad ideas in favor of better ones.

Finally, the host asked how ordinary workers could achieve a career like theirs. Jeff Dean suggested that following industry trends and communicating with colleagues, as well as paying attention to research papers, is the best way to learn about new and interesting fields. Noam Shazeer emphasized the importance of humility again.

This interview provides some valuable lessons for workers, such as being able to let go of bad ideas and accept better ones, balancing top-down and bottom-up approaches, having flexibility in resource allocation, and explaining exciting research directions to guide teams towards valuable goals.
