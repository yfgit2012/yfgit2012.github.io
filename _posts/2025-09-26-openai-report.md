## How people are using ChatGPT - OpenAI report

<think>
Okay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They provided an article in Chinese about OpenAI's ChatGPT usage report and want a summary in the same language, under 50% of the original length. The user also mentioned including key points and avoiding any preambles.

First, I need to confirm the original language. The content is in Chinese, so the summary should be in Chinese as well. The original article discusses the increase in non-work-related uses of ChatGPT, the top categories of usage, user demographics, growth trends, and insights into user behavior across different groups.

The key points to include are: the 73% non-work usage, the top three categories (practical guidance, information queries, writing), user demographics like gender balance, age distribution, education levels, growth in low-income countries, and the shift in AI's role from productivity tools to decision support and daily life enhancement.

I need to condense this into a concise summary. The original text is quite lengthy, so I'll have to be brief. I'll start by stating the main finding about non-work usage increasing to 73%. Then mention the top three categories. Highlight user demographics, such as the gender balance, age distribution, and education levels. Also, note the growth in low-income countries and the shift in AI's role.

I should avoid including any extra information or preambles. Make sure the summary is under 50% of the original length. Let me check the original length. The original is quite long, so the summary needs to be concise. Focus on the main conclusions without going into detailed statistics unless they're critical.

Finally, structure the summary to include all key points in Chinese, ensuring it's clear and meets the user's requirements. Let me put it all together now.

**摘要**  
OpenAI报告指出，截至2025年7月，ChatGPT非工作类查询占比达70%，远超工作相关使用。核心需求集中在**实用指导（37%）**、**信息查询（25%）**和**写作（26%）**，而编程（4.2%）和人际关系（1.9%）占比极低。用户群体呈现以下特征：  
1. **性别差异缩小**，女性用户占比超半数，偏好写作与实用指导，男性更倾向技术帮助与多媒体。  
2. **年轻群体（18-25岁）**贡献近半消息量，但工作相关使用占比随年龄增长而上升。  
3. **中低收入国家**增速显著，预示AI在新兴市场的潜力。  
4. **高学历与专业职业用户**更倾向将AI用于工作，侧重“询问”而非“执行”，将其视为思维增强工具而非替代劳动力。  
报告核心结论：AI的价值不仅在于提升效率，更在于改善生活体验和增强决策能力，未来增长主力为年轻人和新兴市场，需关注“思维增强”而非单纯“劳动替代”。  

**关键点**  
- 非工作类使用占比超70%，远超工作相关需求。  
- 实用指导、信息查询、写作为三大核心需求。  
- 年轻人和中低收入国家为增长主力。  
- AI角色转向“决策支持”与“生活辅助”，而非单纯替代劳动。</document>

Okay, I need to analyze the provided article and create a summary. The user wants the summary in the same language as the article, which is Chinese, and it should be no more than 50% of the original length. Also, I need to include key points and avoid any preambles.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses OpenAI's internal report on ChatGPT usage, highlighting that non-work-related uses have increased significantly, with practical guidance, information queries, and writing being the top categories. It also mentions user demographics, growth trends, and how different groups use ChatGPT differently. The key findings include the shift from productivity tools to daily use, the dominance of certain categories, and insights into user behavior across age, gender, and education levels.

Next, I need to condense this into a concise summary. I'll start by stating the main finding about non-work usage increasing to 73%. Then mention the top three categories: practical guidance, information queries, and writing. Highlight the user demographics like gender balance, age distribution, and education levels. Also, note the growth in low-income countries and the shift in AI's role from productivity to decision support and daily life enhancement.

I should ensure the summary is under 50% of the original text. Let me check the original length. The original is quite long, so the summary needs to be concise. I'll avoid detailed statistics unless they're critical. Focus on the main conclusions: non-work usage, key categories, user demographics, growth in emerging markets, and the shift towards decision support.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to include key points without extra information, making sure it's in Chinese as required. Let me put it all together now.
