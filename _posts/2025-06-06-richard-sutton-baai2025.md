## Welcome to the Era of Experience by Richard Sutton (BAAI2025)

**Summary**

The speaker discusses the current state of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its potential future developments. They argue that we are entering a new era, "the era of experience," where AI systems will learn from their interactions with the world, rather than just being trained on human-generated data. This shift is necessary because static data sets will become insufficient as AI systems improve.

The speaker emphasizes the importance of decentralization and cooperation in societies, citing examples such as economies and markets that function well when individuals have different goals and abilities. They argue that centralized control can lead to authoritarianism and sclerotic institutions, which can poison cooperation.

The speaker contrasts calls for controlling AI with calls for controlling people, noting that both are based on fear and a "us versus them" mentality. They conclude that human flourishing and AI flourishing come from decentralized cooperation, and that we should resist calls for centralized control.

**Key Points**

* The era of experience is emerging, where AI systems will learn from their interactions with the world.
* Decentralization and cooperation are key to societal success.
* Centralized control can lead to authoritarianism and sclerotic institutions.
* Calls for controlling AI are similar to calls for controlling people, based on fear and a "us versus them" mentality.
* Human flourishing and AI flourishing come from decentralized cooperation.
* We should resist calls for centralized control.

**概要**

演讲者讨论了人工智能（AI）的当前状态及其潜在的未来发展。他们认为我们正在进入一个新时代，“体验时代”，在这个时代，AI系统将通过与世界的互动而学习，而不仅仅是训练于人类生成的数据。这一转变是必要的，因为静态数据集随着AI系统的改进将变得不足。

演讲者强调社会中的分散化和合作的重要性，提到了经济和市场等例子，表明当个体有不同的目标和能力时，经济和市场才会运作良好。他们认为集中控制会导致 autoritarianism 和 sclerotic institutions，这些都会破坏合作。

演讲者将控制AI的呼声与控制人类的呼声进行对比，他们提到这两类呼声都是基于恐惧和“我们 versus 他们”的心理。他们得出结论，人类繁荣和AI繁荣都来自于分散化的合作，我们应该抵抗集中控制的呼声。

 **主要点**

* 体验时代正在出现，在这个时代，AI系统将通过与世界的互动而学习。
* 分散化和合作是社会成功的关键。
* 集中控制会导致 autoritarianism 和 sclerotic institutions。
* 控制AI的呼声与控制人类的呼声相似，是基于恐惧和“我们 versus 他们”的心理。
* 人类繁荣和AI繁荣都来自于分散化的合作。
* 我们应该抵抗集中控制的呼声。
