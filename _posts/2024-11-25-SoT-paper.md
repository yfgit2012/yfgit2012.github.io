## SoT: Can Stories Help LLMs Reason? Curating Information Space Through Narrative

Here is the translation:

"The SoT Framework is a method of enhancing large language models' reasoning abilities using narrative techniques. It does this by providing prompts and guidance, allowing the model to better handle complex reasoning tasks.

The framework has shown excellent performance in three different data sets, including JEEBench, GPT-4, and Llama 3 70B. In these tests, the SoT Framework significantly improved the models' accuracy, and its performance was also notable across various academic disciplines.

Researchers have conducted a thorough analysis of the SoT Framework and identified several key success factors. Firstly, they found that using narrative techniques individually does not yield as good results as combining all techniques. Secondly, they discovered a significant correlation between model size and narrative generation ability. Finally, they evaluated the quality of narratives generated by different models and assessed the frequency of use of various narrative techniques.

For prompt engineers, the SoT Framework may become a powerful tool. It can help them better handle complex reasoning tasks and provide new opportunities and paths to improve large language models' reasoning abilities.

However, the framework also has some limitations. For example, it requires significant computational resources and may increase response times. The implementation cost is relatively high, and more verification tests are needed to prove its effectiveness.

In summary, the SoT Framework is a new path that can help prompt engineers and large language models improve their reasoning abilities and solve complex problems."
