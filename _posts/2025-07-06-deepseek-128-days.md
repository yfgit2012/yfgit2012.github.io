**Summary**

In early 2025, DeepSeek released its R1 large language model, which was comparable to OpenAI's in logical reasoning and shockingly low-priced. However, since the release of R1, there has been no significant development for over four months, with only updates on some models being released. What's behind this silence? A recent article by SemiAnalysis may provide an answer.
