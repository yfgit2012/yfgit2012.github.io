Okay, I need to translate the given document. First, I'll check the language of the content. The text is in Chinese, so according to the instructions, I should translate it into English.

Let me start by reading through the Chinese text to understand the context. The article discusses DeepMind's Genie 3, a world model that allows real-time, controllable AI environments. It talks about the evolution from Genie 1 and 2 to Genie 3, highlighting improvements in video quality, interactivity, and the ability to simulate physical laws. The key points include the significance of world models in achieving AGI, the challenges in training such models (data, algorithms, computational resources), and the comparison with language models like GPT. The article also mentions the importance of world models for AGI, as they enable AI to understand and interact with the physical world, unlike language models that rely on text.

Now, I need to translate this into English while maintaining the original meaning. I'll ensure that the translation is accurate and flows naturally. I'll also check for any technical terms related to AI and make sure they are correctly translated. For example, terms like "world model" should remain as is, but I'll clarify if necessary. 

I should also pay attention to the structure of the original text. The first paragraph introduces Genie 3 and its features. The second paragraph discusses the concept of world models and their challenges. The third paragraph talks about the significance of Genie 3 for AGI and the comparison with language models. I'll maintain this structure in the translation.

I need to make sure that the translation is concise and adheres to the user's instruction of not including any preambles or additional content. The user wants the response to be the translated text only, so I'll avoid any extra explanations or summaries beyond the translation.

Let me start translating sentence by sentence, ensuring that the technical terms are correctly translated and that the meaning is preserved. I'll also check for grammar and coherence in the translated text to ensure it reads smoothly in English.

DeepMind has launched Genie 3, the first real-time, interactive AI world engine capable of simulating physical laws and causal relationships. Genie 3, an evolution from Genie 1 and 2, features 720p resolution, 24FPS frame rate, and prompt-based event mechanisms, enabling dynamic environment generation and user interaction, such as simulating hurricanes or forest scenes while maintaining physical logic consistency. Unlike its predecessors, Genie 3 marks a shift from conceptual validation to practical application, serving as a testing tool for AI understanding of the world.  

World models are considered a critical path to AGI, as they require integrating multimodal data (images, actions, causal chains) far beyond the text-centric capabilities of language models. Training such models is resource-intensive, demanding synthetic data (e.g., games, LiDAR videos), complex algorithms (e.g., RSSM, Mamba architecture), and maintaining logical consistency, such as object motion trajectories and spatial relationships. In contrast, language models rely on text sequence prediction, struggling to simulate physical interactions.  

Genie 3's significance lies in granting AI "perception" capabilities rather than relying solely on language descriptions. Its simulated environments validate strategy feasibility, forming the foundation for autonomous decision-making in intelligent agents. Looking ahead, world models may merge with language models, creating all-encompassing systems to advance AGI. If AI cannot grasp the physical world, its intelligence will remain constrained, akin to human cognition depending on experience rather than language alone.

Okay, I need to analyze the provided article and create a summary in the same language, keeping it under 50% of the original length. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is about DeepMind's Genie 3, a world model that allows real-time, controllable AI environments. It discusses the evolution from Genie 1 and 2 to Genie 3, highlighting improvements in video quality, interactivity, and the ability to simulate physical laws. The key points include the significance of world models in achieving AGI, the challenges in training such models (data, algorithms, computational resources), and the comparison with language models like GPT. The article also mentions the importance of world models for AGI, as they enable AI to understand and interact with the physical world, unlike language models that rely on text.

I need to summarize this into a few paragraphs, keeping the language the same (Chinese), and ensure the summary is concise. I should avoid any preamble and focus on the main points: Genie 3's features, the concept of world models, the challenges in their development, and their importance for AGI. Also, include the key points like the comparison with language models and the role of world models in simulating real-world interactions.

Let me structure the summary by first introducing Genie 3 and its advancements, then discussing the concept of world models, the challenges in their development, and their significance for AGI. Make sure to mention the key figures like Hassabis and the comparison with GPT. Keep each paragraph focused and concise, ensuring the summary is under 50% of the original length.

DeepMind发布Genie 3，作为首个可实时交互的AI世界引擎，其核心在于构建物理规律与因果关系的“世界模型”。Genie 3通过720p分辨率、24FPS帧率及提示式事件机制，实现环境的动态生成与用户交互，如模拟飓风或山林场景，确保物理逻辑一致性。相比前代，Genie 3的突破在于从概念验证转向实际应用，成为AI理解世界的测试工具。  

世界模型被视为AGI的关键路径，因其需整合图像、动作、因果链等多模态数据，远超语言模型的文本处理能力。训练成本高，需合成数据（如游戏、LiDAR视频）及复杂算法（如RSSM、Mamba架构），且需维持逻辑闭环，如物体运动轨迹与空间关系。相比之下，语言模型依赖文本序列预测，难以模拟物理世界。  

Genie 3的意义在于让AI具备“感知”能力，而非仅依赖语言描述。其模拟环境可验证策略可行性，成为智能体自主决策的基础。未来，世界模型或与语言模型融合，形成全能模型，推动AGI发展。若AI无法理解物理世界，其智能性将受限，正如人类认知依赖经验而非语言。
