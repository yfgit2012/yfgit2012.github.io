## Quantum-limited stochastic optical neural networks operating at a few quanta per activation

This is a reference to an academic paper published in Nature Communications. Here's what I can gather from it:

**Title:** Quantum-limited stochastic optical neural networks operating at a few quanta per activation.

**Summary:** This study explores the development of quantum-limited stochastic optical neural networks, which are devices that use light and randomness to mimic the behavior of biological neural systems. The researchers report on their design and operation of these networks using only a few photons (quantum units of light), demonstrating potential applications in fields like artificial intelligence and machine learning.
