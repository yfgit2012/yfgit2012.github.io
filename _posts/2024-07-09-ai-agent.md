## About AI agents

It seems like you've provided a transcript of a video about AI agents, specifically discussing their planning capabilities, user experience, memory, and flow engineering. Here are the three main areas you mentioned:

1. **Planning**: The speaker talks about how language models aren't yet good enough to plan multiple steps implicitly when running in a for loop. To overcome this, developers use external prompting strategies like planning steps explicitly upfront or reflection steps at the end. They mention that future models might have these systems built-in, eliminating the need for explicit prompting.
2. **User Experience**: The speaker discusses how user interfaces will become nicer and more intuitive, referencing Devon, a proposed Alpha Codium flow, which is a new workflow to improve coding results. This new agentic workflow delivers better results and has a different feel to previous workflows.
3. **Memory**: The speaker highlights the importance of memory in AI agents, allowing them to retain information and build upon it. They mention that future models will have this built-in, enabling more efficient and effective planning.

Additionally, you mentioned:

* The idea of flow engineering, which is crucial for designing efficient AI workflows.
* The Alpha Codium paper achieving state-of-the-art coding performance through better flow engineering rather than just better models or prompting strategies.
* The concept of offloading the planning of what to do to human engineers and relying on them as a crutch.

If you'd like me to clarify any specific points or provide more information, please let me know!

1. **Planning**： speaker说语言模型还不够好，不能在for循环中隐式地规划多步骤。要克服这个问题，开发人员使用外部提示策略，如显式地规划步骤或反思步骤。他们提到，将来模型可能会内置这些系统， eliminates 的需要的明确提示。
2. **User Experience**： speaker讨论用户界面将变得更好、更直观，引用Devon，一个拟议中的Alpha Codium流，旨在改善编码结果的新工作流。这个新的智能流程可提供更好的结果，与以前的工作流不同。
3. **Memory**： speaker强调记忆在AI代理中的重要性，让它们能保留信息并建构上下文。他们提到，将来模型将内置此功能，使规划更有效、更高效。

另外，你还提到了：
* 流程工程的概念，对于设计高效的 AI 工作流至关重要。
* Alpha Codium论文通过优化流程工程而非仅靠模型或提示策略就能实现编码性能的领先地位。
* 把规划任务交给人类工程师，让他们作为一种依赖，以便减轻 AI 的负担。
