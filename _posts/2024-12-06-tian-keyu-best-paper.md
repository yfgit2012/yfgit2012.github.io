## NeurIPS best paper award (Tian et.al.)

Here is the translation of the contents in English:

The article discusses a paper written by Tian Kuo Yu while he was working at ByteDance, titled "Visual Self-Referring Modeling: A Scalable Image Generation Approach via Next-Scale Prediction". The analysis concludes that this paper represents a major breakthrough in AI-generated images. The VAR method first demonstrated that GPT-like models can surpass diffusion models in image generation, achieving significantly improved AR and IS scores, and showing clear Scaling Laws and zero-shot generalization abilities.

However, the article also highlights confusion surrounding the paper's authorship, as Tian Kuo Yu is listed as the first author despite being sued by his company during his tenure there. This incident exposes underlying issues with the company's management, including ineffective resource allocation for talented scientists and fatal vulnerabilities in core technology security control.

The consequences of this event may impact Tian Kuo Yu's career development, potentially leading to negative repercussions. However, it is also possible that the parties involved will resolve their differences through communication and compromise.

文章探讨了田柯宇在字节跳动工作期间撰写的一篇论文《视觉自回归建模：基于下一个尺度预测的可扩展图像生成》，并分析了这篇论文代表了AI生成图像领域的重大突破。VAR方法首次证明了GPT类模型可以在图像生成方面超越扩散模型，取得了显著提高的AR和IS得分，并展示出了清晰的Scaling Laws和零样本泛化能力。

然而，田柯宇的论文也引发了一系列混乱，因为他是第一作者，但是在字节跳动工作期间，他被公司起诉。这次事件暴露了公司管理方面存在的问题，如对有才华的科学家分配有效资源的问题，以及核心技术安全管控上的致命漏洞。

这次事件的后果可能会影响田柯宇的职业发展，甚至会给他带来负面的影响。但是，也可能会让双方和解，这取决于他们之间的沟通和妥协。
