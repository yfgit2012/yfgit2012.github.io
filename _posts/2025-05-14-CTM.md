## Sakana AI: Continuous Thought Machines

Here is the translation of the contents into English:

This is an introduction to Continual Thinking Machine (CTM). The article first emphasizes the advantages of using CTM, including better interpretability, accuracy and adaptability. It also highlights CTM's outstanding performance in various tasks such as maze solving, image recognition, sorting, parity check, Q&A MNIST etc.

The author mentions that CTM's neural dynamics are more rich and similar to biological neural signals' multi-scale and periodic oscillations. It also emphasizes that in the Q&A MNIST task, CTM can successfully extract information and perform calculations by means of neural synchrony mechanisms even when recalled numbers exceed the direct "memory window" of neuronal models.

However, CTM also has some disadvantages such as slower training speed and larger parameter quantity. Nevertheless, this new model still brings new ideas and directions to the development of artificial intelligence, especially in integrating long-term dependencies, complex reasoning, and memory-based tasks.

The author also mentions CTM's potential and application scenarios, as well as its role in bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and neuroscience. They also plan to apply CTM to language models, video sequence data, and combine it with principles of biological plasticity for gradient-free optimization.

In summary, CTM is a new AI model that enhances performance and interpretability by simulating human brain's continuous thinking process. It is still an evolving model but its potential and application scenarios are worth looking forward to.

这是对连续思维机器（CTM）的介绍。文章首先强调了使用 CTM 的优势，包括更好的可解释性、准确性和自适应性。它还提到了 CTM 在各种任务中的出色表现，例如迷宫求解、图像识别、排序、奇偶校验、Q&A MNIST 等。

作者提到了 CTM 的神经动态比传统模型更丰富，更像生物神经信号的多尺度和周期性振荡。它还强调了在 Q&A MNIST 任务中 CTM 能够通过神经同步机制成功提取信息并进行计算，即使需要回忆的数字已经超出了神经元模型的直接“记忆窗口”。

但是，CTM 也有一些缺点，如训练速度较慢、参数量大等。然而，这个新的模型仍然为人工智能的发展带来了新思路和方向，特别是在整合长期依赖、进行复杂推理和记忆的任务中。

作者还提到了 CTM 的潜力和应用场景，以及它在弥合人工智能与神经科学之间差距方面的作用。他们还计划将 CTM 应用于语言模型、视频等时序数据，并结合生物可塑性原理进行梯度无关的优化。

总之，CTM 是一个新的人工智能模型，它通过模拟人类大脑的连续思维方式来提升性能和可解释性。它仍然是一个正在发展中的模型，但其潜力与应用场景是值得期待的。
