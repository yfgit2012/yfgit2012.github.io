## Terence Tao: About AI

It appears that this text is a transcript of a speech or conversation between two individuals, likely in an academic setting. The topics discussed include mathematics, artificial intelligence (AI), proof assistants, and the process of choosing research topics.

Here are some key points from the conversation:

* The speaker discusses the idea of changing the foundations of mathematics to homotopy type theory, which is a more robust approach that can handle changes in underlying assumptions.
* They mention the use of proof assistant languages like Lean, but note that it's not based on homotopy type theory and is instead focused on formalizing traditional mathematics.
* The speaker expresses hope for the development of automatic translation methods between different proof languages, which they believe would be a valuable application of AI in mathematics.
* They discuss their own experience going to university at a young age (13) and note that it was not necessarily a determining factor in their success as a mathematician. They emphasize that every person is different and should pursue their education when they are ready.
* The speaker talks about how they choose research topics, citing the importance of social interactions with other mathematicians and attending events to spark interesting conversations and potential research questions.
* Finally, they mention the increasing need for flexibility in mathematics research due to the rapid development of AI and the changing nature of mathematical problems.

The conversation is quite informal and conversational, with the speaker using colloquial expressions and acknowledging their own uncertainty on certain points.

此文本似乎是一段演讲或对话的录音，两个人可能是在学术环境下进行交谈。他们讨论了数学、人工智能（AI）、证据助手和选择研究课题的过程。

以下是对话中几个重要点：

* 讲者讨论改变数学基础到同伦类型理论，这是一种更强大的方法，可以处理潜在假设的变化。
* 他们提到了使用证据助手语言，如Lean，但指出它不是基于同伦类型理论，而是专注于形式化传统数学。
* 讲者表达了希望自动将不同证明语言之间进行翻译的愿望，他们相信这将是一个有价值的应用，将人工智能用于数学中。
* 他们讨论自己的经历，17岁才入大学，并指出这并不一定是决定成就的关键因素。他们强调每个人都是不同的，每个人都应在自己准备好的时候开始学习。
* 讲者谈到如何选择研究课题，他们提到了与其他数学家进行社会交互和参加活动的重要性，通过这些方式可以激发有趣的对话和潜在研究问题。
* 最后，他们提到了由于人工智能的快速发展和数学问题本质的变化，数学研究中的灵活性的日益迫切需要。

这段对话非常随意和口语化，讲者使用了俚谚表达并承认了某些点上的不确定性。
