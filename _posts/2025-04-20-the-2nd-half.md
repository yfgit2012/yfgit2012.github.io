Here are the contents translated into English:

There may be some changes in education in the future, but it is not like that. Although online courses can alleviate some burdens of teachers and improve efficiency, they cannot eliminate the need for teaching professionals. Erman pointed out that the significance of teachers lies in providing immediate help to students with various problems and ensuring students receive guidance and support, so schools will still be resistant to educational automation.

There are obvious intergenerational differences among different age groups. Erman mentioned that human-computer interaction has been around for a long time, but few people pay attention to how to interact with the elderly. He himself encountered many difficulties when learning new technologies, such as using car navigation systems while his 25-year-old grandson prefers Google Maps.

Erman thinks it's not easy to adapt to the rapid technological changes and may take until the next generation grows up. This is because the tech industry is often dominated by young people, and decision-makers and thinkers who interact with the elderly are rare. Even among middle-aged individuals, there can be significant differences in their acceptance and use of technology.

Erman believes that considering the accelerating aging of society, the tech industry should figure out how to incorporate the preferences, needs, and differences of the elderly into its designs. Although there is no good system design yet, he thinks that modern machine learning and large model technologies may be able to do this because they can provide users with more tailored interaction modes based on intentions, and help different types of users with their basic intents.

Erman thinks researching human-computer interaction for the elderly is a worthwhile research topic, even if it may not change the world. If he had to guess which technology might change the world in the future, he would choose quantum computing and general artificial intelligence.

文中提到，未来教育可能会出现一些变革，但实际情况并非如此。虽然慕课可以减轻教师的一些负担提高效率，但它无法消除对教学专业人员的需求。厄尔曼指出，教师的意义在于随时帮助学生解决遇到的各种问题、确保学生得到帮助和引导，所以学校对于教学自动化还是会比较抗拒的。

不同的年龄段也存在着明显的代际差异，厄尔曼提到人机交互领域其实已经存在了很长时间，但很少有人关注怎么去跟老年人打交道。他自己在学习使用新技术的时候遇到了很多困难，比如他习惯用车载导航系统，而他25岁的孙子却更喜欢用谷歌地图。

厄尔曼认为，对于如何让人们适应正在发生的技术变化这件事情并不容易，恐怕要等到下一代人成长起来才行，因为科技行业往往是年轻人的游戏。做决策和负责思考这些事情的人可能很少与老年人互动，即使是中年人个体之间对技术的接受和使用方式也有很大的不同。

厄尔曼认为，考虑到社会正在加速老龄化，科技行业确实需要弄清楚如何纳入老年人的偏好、需求和差异。目前虽然还没有看到真正好的系统设计，但他觉得利用现代的机器学习和大模型技术或许能够做到这一点，因为它们能够向特定的群体提供更多基于意图的用户交互范式，还能够随时做出解释推理出用户的基本意图，从而帮助到不同需求的用户。

厄尔曼认为关注老年人的人机交互研究是一个不错的研究课题，虽然它可能不至于改变世界，但也值得去关注。如果非要猜测未来可能改变世界的技术，他会选择量子计算和通用人工智能。
